//! Optional analytics and usage sources — `org.licoland.feature.analytics`.
//!
//! This is M29: the package that owns statistics sources, the query index, the
//! dashboard definitions and specialist metrics, and it *consumes* the core's
//! retained metering facts rather than keeping a second economic ledger. Three
//! separations are structural here, and each is enforced rather than described:
//!
//! - **The trusted account is not this package.** [`facts::CoreUsageFacts`] is
//!   the narrow port over the core slice (M33): the minimal metering facts,
//!   their pending obligations and their settlement. This package borrows it,
//!   records eligible facts through it and never owns it, so uninstalling the
//!   package cannot delete a budget or a run fact, and a panel cannot become a
//!   ledger.
//! - **A producer's quality is not settlement authority.** [`policy`] decides
//!   which sources may settle from a host grant table. A source that reports
//!   `reported` gains nothing by saying so; an unprivileged source is displayed
//!   with its provenance and never recorded as a settlement.
//! - **Display is a prepared declaration.** [`panels`] mounts declarative
//!   `metric-panel` contributions and hands out prepared values whose unknown
//!   readings are unknown, not zero. A redraw reads prepared values; it does not
//!   re-scan a source.
//!
//! The package is optional and lazy: nothing here starts a collector. A scraper
//! exists only for a source the host configured while the package is active, and
//! [`package::AnalyticsPackage::activate`] refuses to build anything at all when
//! the capability is not installed — the absence is reported through the
//! contract's capability vocabulary, not as a failure of the client.
//!
//! Deduplication, corrections, cumulative resets and the single settlement of a
//! call reported by several sources are [`index`] and [`correlation`]; the input
//! mapping they consume is the usage-source SDK's.
