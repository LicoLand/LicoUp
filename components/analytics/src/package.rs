//! The analytics package: admission, reconciliation, panels and uninstall.
//!
//! This is where the pieces meet, and where the two acceptance rules are
//! enforced end to end:
//!
//! - **One call settles once.** [`AnalyticsPackage::admit`] ingests an
//!   observation into the index, reconciles its scope and metric, and records at
//!   most one fact per measurement through the core port. A second source
//!   reporting the same call is either the authoritative report of the same fact
//!   (an update) or corroboration; a conflict without a host-issued measurement
//!   or an explicit priority is [`Admission::Ambiguous`] and records nothing.
//! - **Uninstall releases the package, not the history.** The package borrows
//!   the core facts; [`AnalyticsPackage::begin_uninstall`] stops new admission
//!   and releases panels, prepared values and scrapers, and
//!   [`AnalyticsPackage::complete_uninstall`] drops the index once in-flight
//!   reads have drained. The facts are not the package's to delete.
//!
//! Nothing here starts a collector on its own: a scraper exists only for a
//! source the host configured while the package is active, and activation itself
//! is refused when the capability is not installed or not enabled, so an
//! installation without the analytics package has no collector to start.
