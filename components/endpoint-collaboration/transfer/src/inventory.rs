//! The owned transfer inventory.
//!
//! This composes the full-data-root archive owner rather than duplicating it.
//! `licoup_foundation` already walks the logical data root, refuses non-portable
//! paths, applies the extraction limits and reports the credential-custody
//! limitation; what it deliberately does not decide is what a *transfer* must do
//! with each area. This module answers exactly that question:
//!
//! * a **managed payload** travels in the archive and is restored by its owner,
//! * an **external reference** names something the archive cannot carry and that
//!   its own owner must re-establish, and
//! * a **nonportable credential** must be re-entered, re-signed-in or
//!   re-authorized on the new device by the person who owns it.
//!
//! Nothing here reports a credential value, a key, or a secret. A requirement is
//! a domain plus a fixed custody classification, so there is no field a value
//! could be written into.
