//! The optional endpoint collaboration package boundary.
//!
//! `org.licoland.feature.endpoint-collaboration` is the installable capability
//! that owns paired-device pairing, secure mesh relay delivery and remote work
//! control. The kernel owns custody, durable state, the Canonical Conversation
//! and authority; this package reaches them only through those ports, and a
//! client without the package keeps every local conversation, running work and
//! history it already has.
//!
//! Two rules are the whole reason this vocabulary exists:
//!
//! * **Absent and disabled are answers, not an absence of an answer.** The
//!   boundary names which of *missing*, *disabled*, *capability-undeclared* and
//!   *active* the host resolved, and a caller that only knows how to hide a user
//!   interface cannot answer either of the first three.
//! * **The outbound send is the boundary.** Outbound endpoint traffic is
//!   permitted only while the capability resolves active. Refusing at the send
//!   entry is what makes "disabled" a cut rather than a hidden control, and it is
//!   the one behavior a user interface can neither grant nor fake.
//!
//! Nothing here performs a cryptographic operation, opens a store or sends a
//! packet: it decides *whether the capability may act at all*, and the kernel's
//! own owners perform the operation once the authority is granted.
