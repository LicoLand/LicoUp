"""The smallest complete Agent: the handshake, describe, execute and events.

It streams its input back verbatim, calls no model and keeps no session. It
implements none of the optional methods, and that is a complete extension, not
a degraded one: `agent.describe` truthfully reports `usage: unavailable`,
`cancel: unsupported` and `resume: unsupported`, and basic execution and events
are served exactly as usual.

Replay the recorded session with:

    python3 -B agent.py < transcript.jsonl
