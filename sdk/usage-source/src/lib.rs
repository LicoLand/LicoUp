//! C11 usage-source SDK: one input mapping for three collection directions.
//!
//! A usage source is a producer of *observations*, not of charges, and it may
//! deliver them in any of the three shapes the C11 profile allows:
//!
//! - **push** — `usage.publish` sends a bounded batch of observations;
//! - **bounded pull** — `usage.query(cursor, limit, scopeRef)` asks for one
//!   bounded page;
//! - **cursor** — the same query resumed from the position a previous page
//!   returned.
//!
//! This crate makes those three directions converge on exactly one mapped value:
//! [`BoundObservation`] — a [`UsageObservation`] whose source identity, epoch,
//! authorized scope and (when the host knows it) logical measurement were
//! attached by the transport, never by the payload. [`collection`] carries the
//! three directions and their bounds, [`binding`] performs the attachment and
//! the refusals, [`normalize`] maps vendor-shaped records (a field-mapped JSON
//! record, a log line, an OTLP-shaped cumulative series) onto the same
//! observation at the boundary, and [`describe`] is the `usage.describe`
//! declaration a source publishes about its own fields and series.
//!
//! Four rules are structural here rather than conventional:
//!
//! - **A source never names itself.** A payload that carries `source`,
//!   `extensionId`, `instanceId`, a generation, a registry epoch, a scope or a
//!   measurement identity is refused; those are the host's facts about the
//!   binding, and accepting them would let a producer attach itself to another
//!   user's run or merge two calls into one charge.
//! - **A cursor belongs to one epoch and one scope.** Resuming from a cursor
//!   whose epoch was replaced is refused, because silently skipping or
//!   re-reading a cumulative series is how a reset turns into a wrong total.
//! - **A missing metric is absent, never zero.** Tokens, cost and model are
//!   optional beyond the observation's identity, and a producer that does not
//!   know a count says [`Quality::Unknown`] rather than claiming nothing
//!   happened.
//! - **A batch is bounded.** The number of observations and the encoded frame
//!   both have limits, so a chatty source cannot turn into a client that stops
//!   responding.
//!
//! The deduplication, correction, cumulative-reset and multi-source
//! single-settlement semantics are the *consumer's* side of this contract; they
//! live with the optional analytics package that reads these values, not in the
//! producer SDK. This crate never computes a charge, never stores a ledger and
//! never opens a network connection.
