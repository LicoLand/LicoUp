//! Consumer-owned ports the client adapter must supply to the pinned LicoArc SDK.
//!
//! LicoUp owns custody, persistence, time, and transport; the SDK owns the
//! protocol. These traits are the caller side of that split, reduced from the
//! caller-owned requirements the pinned SDK revision actually declares.
//! Every item cites the SDK source it mirrors, read at revision
//! `244ce7186cac1690c18f091dbe02df36a0860ef4`
//! (`licoarc-rust/src/...`, package `licoarc`):
//!
//! | port | SDK requirement |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`KeyCustody`] | `state::KeyCustody`, `src/state/mod.rs:175-211` |
//! | [`AtomicState`] | `state::AtomicState`, `src/state/mod.rs:452-468` |
//! | [`Clock`] | `state::Clock`, `src/state/mod.rs:222-224` |
//! | [`Transport`] | `state::PacketCarrier` + `transport::TransportOutcome`, `src/state/mod.rs:470-472`, `src/transport.rs:214-230` |
//!
//! These are consumer-owned traits: no SDK type appears in their signature, so
//! this crate stays dependency-free and the adapter that satisfies both sides
//! lives in the crate that composes them. Nothing here re-implements protocol
//! policy: the SDK alone decides protocol outcomes, and a port only performs the
//! caller-owned operation it is asked for.
//!
//! The pairing and relay-control branches of `transport` are deliberately
//! absent. Pairing ships as an optional collaboration package, so a client
//! without it initializes no pairing state and starts no listener; the packet
//! path below is what a client without that package actually needs.
