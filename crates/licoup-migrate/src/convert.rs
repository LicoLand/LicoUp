//! Run the client's own conversion and report what it concluded.
//!
//! This module holds no conversion logic. The client's migration owner is the only
//! implementation of every domain move, and it already carries the typed semantics this
//! tool does not have: the canonical conversation import runs through the Conversation
//! owner, and the strategy store is canonicalised by the workflow compiler. A second
//! implementation here would be exactly the duplicated authority the delivery forbids,
//! and it would drift from the client on the first schema change.
//!
//! What this module owns is the *report*: for each domain it was asked about, the tool
//! says whether the client converted it, found it already current, still needs platform
//! authority for it, or did not account for it at all. Completion is never inferred.
