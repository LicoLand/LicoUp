//! Export and import the complete data root.
//!
//! Neither verb implements archiving, and neither implements a second recovery policy.
//! Both route to the client's own native recovery composition
//! (`licoup_native::domain::local_recovery`), which the installed client's `backup`
//! command uses: the Foundation full-data-root owner captures, verifies and publishes,
//! and the composition rebases owner-managed references for a different home and
//! re-establishes the workflow revision invariants through their owner. This module only
//! marshals the caller's options and renders the owner's own outcome, so the container
//! format, the inventory, the recovery-coverage rule and the recovery repair keep exactly
//! one authority; a second implementation here would be a second answer to "what is
//! inside the archive".
//!
//! Two rules belong to the owner and are reported without reinterpretation: a capture
//! requires the caller's statement that every writer is stopped, and a restore requires
//! an empty destination and a manifest that matches every member. A refusal therefore
//! publishes nothing and is never rendered as a completed export or import.
