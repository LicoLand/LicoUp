//! Continue an interrupted conversion until it is unambiguously finished or blocked.
//!
//! A resume is not a second conversion. The journal names the steps one run declared; this
//! module drives those steps through the client's own owner one at a time and records what
//! the owner reported, so a process that stops between two steps is continued rather than
//! restarted. Three properties are what the resume is built around:
//!
//! 1. **One result.** A step is committed only when the owner reports it applied or already
//!    current *and* the client's observed state shows the version the journal asked for. A
//!    journal entry that claims a commit the store does not support is a refusal, never a
//!    repair.
//! 2. **No duplication.** The only record of a conversion is the client's own ledger and
//!    its domain markers, both written by the owner under its own lock. This module never
//!    writes either; it writes only its own snapshot, which the owner never reads. A
//!    resumed domain is therefore recorded once by construction, and the resume regression
//!    asserts that the client's ledger is byte-identical afterwards.
//! 3. **A blocked run stays visibly blocked.** A step the owner cannot complete — platform
//!    credential custody is the live case — leaves the run paused with that domain named,
//!    and a journal that still owes steps is never closed.
//!
//! Interruption points are exercised at runtime through [`Interrupter`]. The seam exists
//! because the interesting failure is a process that stops **between** two durable writes,
//! and no integration test can deliver a real `SIGKILL` at a chosen instruction from
//! outside the process. The permitted points are the boundaries the durability claim is
//! made at, and the regression in `tests/resume.rs` runs the whole resume once per point.
