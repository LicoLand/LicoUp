//! One rehearsal entry: convert a released-format root and round-trip it, reporting
//! exactly which stages ran.
//!
//! The rehearsal is not a second migration and not a second archive. It sequences the
//! owners that already exist — the client's own admission owner for conversion, the native
//! full-data-root archive owner for capture and restore — and turns their verdicts into one
//! report. Nothing here decides what a domain is, what a container holds or what a target
//! version is.
//!
//! Three properties are what the entry is built around:
//!
//! 1. **The named root is only ever read.** Conversion and archiving happen against a
//!    disposable copy this module creates inside the caller's working directory, so a
//!    rehearsal on a machine with live state cannot change it. The copy is the subject, and
//!    a failed stage therefore cannot be confused with a converted or restored root.
//! 2. **Every stage is explicit.** The report carries the whole stage list on every run. A
//!    stage that did not run is reported as not run with the stage that blocked it, never
//!    omitted, so a partial rehearsal cannot read as a complete recovery.
//! 3. **The roots speak for themselves.** Every stage records the fingerprint of the root it
//!    produced, so an independent comparison can read what is on disk instead of trusting
//!    this report. A stage whose named root is absent fails its own oracle.
//!
//! A refusal that belongs to the run rather than to a stage — a source that is not at the
//! last published format, a missing source, a missing writer statement — is returned as a
//! typed [`ToolError`] before anything is written. A refusal that belongs to a stage — an
//! export the owner declines, a restore the owner rejects — is recorded on that stage and
//! leaves every later stage visibly not run.
