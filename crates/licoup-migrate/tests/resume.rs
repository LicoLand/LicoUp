//! An interrupted conversion resumes to exactly one result.
//!
//! Two interruption points carry the durability claim, and this regression visits each of
//! them on a disposable root:
//!
//! * **before the owner**: the process stopped with the step recorded as attempted and the
//!   root untouched. A resume must complete the step exactly once.
//! * **after the owner**: the process stopped after the client's owner had produced its
//!   durable result and before this tool recorded it. A resume must report the domain
//!   already current and add no second record.
//!
//! The oracle is the client's own record, not this tool's opinion of itself. The client's
//! ledger holds one completed step id per conversion, so:
//!
//! * the total number of completed step ids must be the same after a resume as after a
//!   single uninterrupted conversion,
//! * no domain may list the same step id twice, and
//! * the ledger's bytes must be unchanged when a resume had nothing left to do.
//!
//! Source preservation is asserted against a fingerprint of the client's own files taken
//! before any conversion ran. Converting must not replace the source: the seeded rows are
//! still there afterwards, and the authority that moves them is the client's owner rather
//! than a second implementation in this tool.
//!
//! Both acceptance cases run once per permitted interruption point, so a point that no case
//! visits is itself a failure.
