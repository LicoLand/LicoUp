//! The recorded-transcript replay arm for Hermes.
//!
//! The arm constructs the same persistent ACP session reducer the production
//! Hermes transport constructs, keyed by the same driver identity, so a recorded
//! transcript can only pass if Hermes' real dialect still reports the recorded
//! facts. The projection, the corpus resolution and the fail-closed properties
//! stay in the SDK's harness; this module is the one thing the harness cannot
//! know — how to build *this* Agent's arm.
//!
//! It is behind `test-support` rather than `cfg(test)` because the host's replay
//! suite drives it, and the host links this crate as a dependency: `cfg(test)`
//! is false for a dependency, so a `cfg(test)` arm is compiled out of exactly the
//! build that calls it.
//!
//! The reducer resolves Hermes' dialect from the transport's port by driver
//! identity, exactly as a production session does: a build that installed the
//! composition reads the composition's Hermes dialect, and a build that installed
//! none reads the transport's own test dialect, whose frame readers are the same
//! shared ACP semantics. The arm installs nothing, so it can never displace the
//! dialects a running composition already installed.
