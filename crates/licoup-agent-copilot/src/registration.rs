//! The registration this package publishes to the adapter SDK's ports, and the
//! frame dialect it publishes to the shared ACP engine's.
//!
//! The SDK owns the port ([`licoup_agent_adapter_sdk::port::AdapterParserSet`]);
//! this package owns the answer, because it owns the parser. Composition reads
//! [`REGISTRATION`] and hands it to the SDK's registry, replay harness and host
//! queries, so adding this Agent's crate is one entry rather than four lists
//! that can drift.
//!
//! The shared ACP engine owns its own port
//! ([`licoup_agent_drivers::AcpParserRegistration`]); this package owns the
//! answer there too, because it owns the frame policy. Composition installs
//! [`DIALECT`] by driver identity, so the transport reads Copilot's frames
//! without naming Copilot.
//!
//! Copilot answers both protocol-agnostic SDK queries fail-closed, exactly as
//! it did as a host-held parser: its driver carries the transitions its own
//! reducer built, and the Subagent mesh never dispatches it, so there is no
//! durable dispatch identity for this Agent to validate. Declaring that here is
//! the honest answer; answering with a neighbouring Agent's facts would not be.
