//! Pure durable-dispatch decisions for the Adaptive Flywheel.
//!
//! Dispatch is the boundary between durable intent and an external effect. The
//! store commits authority and the dispatch intent first; only then may an
//! adapter leave the host. This module owns the *decisions* taken at that
//! boundary so every host reaches the same verdict from the same durable facts,
//! without SQLite, a clock of its own, or a process identity.
//!
//! # What this module refuses to know
//!
//! A previous host process disappearing is **not** an input to any decision
//! here. There is deliberately no `host_restarted`, `process_exited` or
//! `previous_pid` field anywhere in this module, because process exit alone is
//! not lease revocation, not effect loss, and not authority to repeat an
//! external effect. Recovery is decided only from the persisted lease clock and
//! the persisted effect progress:
//!
//! * an **unexpired** claim is [`RecoveryVerdict::Held`] — the claimant still
//!   owns it, whoever that claimant was and whatever happened to its process;
//! * an **expired** claim whose effect never started is
//!   [`RecoveryVerdict::Reclaimable`];
//! * an **expired** claim whose effect was already in flight is
//!   [`RecoveryVerdict::InDoubt`] and is never blindly repeated;
//! * a **settled** claim is [`RecoveryVerdict::AlreadyCompleted`].
