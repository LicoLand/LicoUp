//! Durable admitted obligations: outbound work this client owes once it has
//! admitted it.
//!
//! The protocol layer decides what an obligation *is*: the pinned SDK commits a
//! delivery unit together with the protocol snapshot, and the caller-owned ports
//! ([`crate::state::AtomicState`], mirrored for the adapter in
//! `licoup_endpoint_core::ports`) hand that same unit back when it is re-driven or
//! settled. This module owns the client-side question the ports leave open:
//! **which obligations may be discarded, and by what**.
//!
//! The rules are the ones the cross-device delivery boundary requires, and each is
//! falsifiable from this module's public surface:
//!
//! * **Admission is the irreversible step.** Nothing is owed before
//!   [`ObligationLedger::admit`], so a refused or abandoned attempt costs only its
//!   staged bytes, and pre-admission staging is bounded and refuses with
//!   backpressure instead of growing.
//! * **An admitted obligation is never discarded by elapsed time or retry count.**
//!   A rejected, transient or ambiguous delivery keeps its obligation and
//!   increments an attempt counter; only an accepted settlement removes it.
//!   `attempts` is reported, never a permit to drop owed material.
//! * **A budget sweep cannot discard owed material.** [`ObligationLedger::sweep`]
//!   reclaims only pre-admission staging and refuses while any admitted obligation
//!   is outstanding, so local space pressure cannot erase what this client owes.
//! * **Restart recovers the same obligations.** [`ObligationLedger::durable_record`]
//!   is the whole owed set; the ledger rebuilt from it re-drives exactly those
//!   deliveries, with their attempts and their generation intact.
//!
//! Nothing here performs protocol verification, chooses a transport outcome, or
//! classifies a relay response: it records the caller's own answer and keeps the
//! obligation until that answer is acceptance.
