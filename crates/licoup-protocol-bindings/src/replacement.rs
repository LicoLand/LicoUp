//! Device replacement authority through the pinned SDK's own verification entries.
//!
//! This is the client-side consumer of the LicoArc stable-core replacement
//! surface. It never decides a protocol outcome: it calls the SDK entry that
//! owns the decision and hands back exactly what that entry verified. Every rule
//! below names the SDK behaviour it mirrors, read at revision
//! `244ce7186cac1690c18f091dbe02df36a0860ef4`.
//!
//! # What the SDK owns
//!
//! | decision | SDK entry |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | the signed management/recovery transition, its epoch and its predecessor | `validate_user_authority_state`, `src/identity.rs:129-311` |
//! | the new-device possession proof | reached inside the same entry, `src/identity.rs:286-302` |
//! | the replacement possession proof over the new authority keys | same entry, `src/identity.rs:593-638`; the message is `replacement_possession_input`, `src/identity.rs:111-127` |
//! | the authenticated session, its authority digest and its active device entry | `admit_protected_authority_payload`, `src/identity.rs:351-406` |
//!
//! Nothing here re-verifies a signature and no local type mirrors an SDK type:
//! the adapter calls [`licoarc::identity::admit_protected_authority_payload`] and
//! returns the SDK's own [`AcceptedUserAuthority`]. `verify_replacement_possession`
//! is private in the SDK (`src/identity.rs:593`) and is deliberately *not*
//! re-implemented here; it is reached only through the two public entries above.
//!
//! # Why the binding lives elsewhere
//!
//! The SDK verifies that *some* subject's roster accepted *some* device. It
//! cannot know which replacement the local person asked for, which source device
//! it replaces, or which operation it performs. That comparison is
//! `licoup_endpoint_core::replacement`, whose vocabulary has no dependencies at
//! all, and the platform adapter that composes both sides is
//! `licoup_native::domain::mobile_relay::endpoint_ports`. This crate may not
//! reach either of them: the lane's direction is
//! `platform adapter → protocol bindings → fixed SDK`
//! (`tests/dependency_direction.rs:22-27`). Keeping the SDK delegation here and
//! the binding there is what makes that direction hold.
//!
//! # No side effect before admitted authority
//!
//! [`SdkReplacementAuthority`] holds no store, opens no transport, starts no
//! listener and reads no clock. It is constructed with an
//! `Option<VerifiedProtocolLine>`: a build without an admitted Candidate
//! constructs the refusing form and reports
//! [`ReplacementAdmissionRefusal::NoAdmittedLine`] without borrowing another
//! source's authority.
