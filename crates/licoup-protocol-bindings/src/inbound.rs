//! Inbound verification through the pinned SDK's own verification entries.
//!
//! This is the client-side consumer of the fixed Candidate. It never decides a
//! protocol outcome: it calls the SDK entry that owns each decision and records
//! what that entry verified. Every fact below names the SDK entry that produced
//! it, read at revision `244ce7186cac1690c18f091dbe02df36a0860ef4`.
//!
//! One inbound unit yields one [`TrustFacts`] binding:
//!
//! | fact | SDK verification entry |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | author | handshake: `FirstPacket::initiator_user_authority_state_digest`, accepted by `Endpoint::accept_first_packet`, `src/endpoint/mod.rs:534-652` |
//! | device | handshake: `FirstPacket::initiator_identity_state_digest` plus the accepted ed25519/ml-dsa key ids, and `TrustedIdentity::resolve` for the identity trust facts, `src/endpoint/mod.rs:69-108` |
//! | permission | per unit: `AuthorizedSession::{authenticated,sender_authorized,sender_endpoint,expected_sender_endpoint}`, refused by `reliable::apply_endpoint_confirmation`, `src/reliable.rs:79-88`; the roster layer above it adds `AuthenticatedAuthoritySession::authenticated` and the active-device check, `src/identity.rs:365-397`, reached through [`EndpointConsumer::admit_authority`] |
//! | protocol version | client: [`crate::version::AcceptedVersion`], plus the SDK's own line binding `src/identity.rs:145-147` |
//! | replay identity | handshake: `SessionAccept::{transcript_digest,session_context_digest}`, `src/endpoint/mod.rs:605-624`; record: the `PendingId` of `Endpoint::receive_record`, `src/endpoint/mod.rs:1009-1041` |
//!
//! Raw wire is not the client's internal schema, and a local event sequence is
//! not network author order. The identities this module exposes are the SDK's
//! own: message and session ids are network identities, and a confirmation's
//! confirmed ids must be strictly increasing (`validate_confirmation_ids`,
//! `src/reliable.rs:225-234`), so a client cannot substitute arrival order.
//!
//! Four facts are reported separately and never collapsed into one "delivered"
//! boolean:
//!
//! * message delivery — [`EndpointConsumer::note_delivery`], the peer endpoint
//!   accepted the logical message (`ConfirmationStage::EndpointAccepted`);
//! * reliable exchange — [`EndpointConsumer::note_exchange`], the intent's own
//!   retry/migration state (`ReliableState`, `src/reliable.rs:172-219`);
//! * user read — [`UserRead`], client-owned: the pinned SDK has no read receipt;
//! * task acceptance — [`EndpointConsumer::note_acceptance`], which the SDK
//!   grants only for `ConfirmationStage::EffectCompleted` with the expected
//!   result digest (`src/reliable.rs:121-150`).
//!
//! A peer message identity is never promoted to authority: the permission facts
//! come from the session the SDK authenticated, and a capability proxy's command
//! must re-enter the Graph admission path exactly like any other command.
