//! Fixed-input admission and inbound verification for the LicoArc Candidate.
//!
//! LicoUp owns caller-side trust, custody, persistence, and application
//! effects. The Protocol Line, its definitions, and all cryptography stay with
//! LicoArc and the LicoArc Rust SDK. This crate is the one boundary between
//! them:
//!
//! * [`admission`] accepts an explicitly supplied authority artifact, or refuses
//!   it fail-closed with [`AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED`] before any persistent write,
//!   network I/O, or effect;
//! * [`version`] freezes the one Protocol Line version this client accepts and
//!   refuses any other version for that call only;
//! * [`inbound`] runs the SDK's own verification entries and records what they
//!   verified as an explicit [`inbound::TrustFacts`] value.
//!
//! The fixed input is pinned by the revision-pinned `licoarc` dependency in the
//! workspace manifest, so a different line can only arrive as a deliberate
//! upgrade rather than by following an upstream branch.
//!
//! # Blocked scope
//!
//! No authority artifact is bundled implicitly. Calls without an explicitly
//! admitted artifact block only the branch that requires it; callers supplying
//! the fixed Candidate can exercise that branch. Local verification, admission
//! geometry, the version contract, and caller-owned ports stay unblocked.
