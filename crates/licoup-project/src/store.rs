//! The durable project store.
//!
//! One SQLite database inside the existing client-state root, opened with the
//! rules the workflow store already uses: private directories, a schema version
//! recorded in a meta table, and a connection configured for full synchronous
//! writes. Registered identities and declared dependency inputs share that one
//! database, so a dependency never needs a second store to stay consistent with
//! the projects it names. Neither table has a column that could hold a
//! credential — authority is the reference the caller declared, and a
//! dependency is the reference the caller declared, so there is nothing to
//! duplicate.
//!
//! Registration and admission are each one immediate transaction: the checks and
//! the insert commit together or not at all. An artifact state is never stored;
//! it is read from the declared roots and the declared index each time, so a
//! stored row can never claim a result that has since gone away.
