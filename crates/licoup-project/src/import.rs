//! The canonical plan document and its correspondence to a source.
//!
//! One typed import contract stands between an arbitrary source document and the
//! project domain. The source may be prose, a spreadsheet, an issue list or a
//! generated roadmap, and it stays exactly as it is: this owner never opens it,
//! never rewrites it and never keeps a copy of it. What crosses the boundary is
//! one canonical JSON document ([`PlanDocument`]) that a caller deliberately
//! produces, plus the attribution that says which source and which place in it
//! every work item came from.
//!
//! Five rules keep the boundary trustworthy:
//!
//! - **Identity is declared, never derived.** Project, plan, work item, source,
//!   role and capability are bounded caller-declared identities. Nothing here
//!   walks a directory or reads a document to name something.
//! - **Declarations are not facts.** A plan work item declares an outcome, the
//!   acceptance criteria it will be judged by, the results it takes and the
//!   roles that may act on it. It cannot carry, and this owner refuses to admit,
//!   any assertion that a runtime task ran, completed or was accepted: those
//!   facts belong to the work owner that observed them and are never imported.
//! - **Source correspondence is attribution.** Every work item carries the
//!   anchor it was read from, and every admitted work item is reported back with
//!   that anchor, so a disagreement can be taken to the exact place in the
//!   source instead of to a whole document.
//! - **Ambiguity is reported, never guessed.** An unknown field, a foreign
//!   schema, a duplicate identity, an input that names a work item this plan does
//!   not declare, and a cycle between declared inputs are all reported by code
//!   and by path before any effect exists. An empty declaration is refused by
//!   name rather than read as "remove everything".
//! - **Resolution is bounded and happens once.** [`PlanDocument::admit`] indexes
//!   the submitted work items and resolves every in-plan input against that one
//!   index, in work proportional to the document, and returns the whole report
//!   before anything is stored.
//!
//! Canonical JSON is the transport of this one model, not a second source
//! format family: the same types serialize the preview a caller can show and the
//! payload the apply path stores, so a field cannot mean one thing on the way in
//! and another on the way out.
