//! One completed Kilo turn, projected onto the shared driver result.
//!
//! The projection is a field copy, not a second derivation: the parser already
//! reported the assistant text and the native tool interactions, and the request
//! already carries the settings the turn ran with. Nothing is re-read from a
//! vendor document here, and nothing is invented that the endpoint did not say.
//!
//! The capability answer is this Agent's own declaration of what its endpoint
//! supports. It is produced in exactly one place so the probe the host runs
//! before offering the Agent and the result of a real turn cannot disagree.
