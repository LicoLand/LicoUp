//! The registration this package publishes to the adapter SDK's ports.
//!
//! The SDK owns the port ([`licoup_agent_adapter_sdk::port::AdapterParserSet`]);
//! this package owns the answer, because it owns the parser. Composition reads
//! [`parser_set`] and hands it to the SDK's registry, replay harness and host
//! queries, so adding this Agent's crate is one entry rather than four lists
//! that can drift.
//!
//! Both protocol-agnostic queries the SDK declares are answered here, from this
//! Agent's own evidence, rather than left fail-closed:
//!
//! - [`execution_transitions`] turns one Kilo execution outcome into the shared
//!   transition vocabulary.
//! - [`valid_identity`] answers whether a durable native session identity is a
//!   real Kilo session, judged from the identity this Agent's own endpoint would
//!   answer with.
//!
//! The adapter id and framing are this Agent's declaration, and the framing is
//! the same string its fixtures record, so a corpus cannot pass against another
//! channel.
