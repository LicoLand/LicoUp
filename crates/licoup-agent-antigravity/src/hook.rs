//! The Antigravity Agent Hooks receipt, written natively.
//!
//! Antigravity's official Stop-hook contract hands the hook one JSON document on
//! stdin and expects one JSON document on stdout. LicoUp registers one global
//! Stop hook whose only job is to record *which* native conversation the turn
//! just ran, so the client can resume exactly that conversation later.
//!
//! The hook used to be a generated `/bin/sh` script that piped its payload into
//! `python3`. That placed an interpreter between the vendor client and this
//! package: a machine without `python3` silently lost the conversation identity,
//! and the interpreter's presence was never part of LicoUp's declared runtime.
//! This module is that hook, in the package's own program, with no interpreter
//! and no third program in the path.
//!
//! # What it writes
//!
//! One receipt file, named by the `LICO_ANTIGRAVITY_SESSION_RECEIPT` environment
//! variable the launching driver exports for the turn, containing
//! `{"conversationId":"<id>"}`. The file is created owner-only (`0600`) and is
//! replaced atomically through a sibling temporary file, so a reader never sees
//! a half-written receipt and a crash never leaves an unreadable one.
//!
//! # Writer-order safety
//!
//! A vendor-direct receipt can already exist on the same path when this hook
//! runs. The identity is therefore resolved in one order — the hook payload's
//! own id, then the vendor environment's id, then whatever the existing receipt
//! already recorded — and an empty result never erases a conversation a previous
//! writer bound in the same turn. The resolution is
//! [`crate::parser::parse_hook_receipt`]'s, on the text this hook received, so
//! the writer and the reader share one rule rather than two.
