//! Grouped backend ports.
//!
//! Each port is one family of business work, implemented by the native
//! application. The ports exist so both interfaces reach the *same*
//! implementation: a CLI call and an MCP call for one operation arrive at one
//! trait method, which is what makes identical authority and a single effect
//! structural rather than a promise.
//!
//! Verification stays native. [`ActorPort::verify`] is the one place that
//! decides whether a structurally valid claim is true, and the facade calls it
//! once before any family port runs.

/// Implementations own the real check the process can make about *this caller*:
/// the in-process owner is the process itself, and a provider claim must be one
/// the local mesh admits. The facade runs this once per command, before any
/// family port.
///
/// Whether a caller is active in a conversation, and whether it owns the
/// membership it acts as, is a durable question. The domain owner answers it
/// against the conversation store before any effect — the facade cannot, and a
/// port that repeated it would only add a second answer that could disagree.
