//! Results and stable operation references.

//! A caller needs to be able to ask "what happened to the thing I started?"
//! without knowing which interface started it. [`OperationReference`] is that
//! answer: one identity per operation, carrying the state the product already
//! publishes on receipts, so a CLI call and an MCP call for the same operation
//! return the same reference rather than two lookalikes.
