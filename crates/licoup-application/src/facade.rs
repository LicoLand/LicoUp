//! The single business entry both interfaces call.
//!
//! Order matters and is fixed here, once:
//!
//! 1. the claim is structurally valid;
//! 2. the command is structurally valid;
//! 3. the claim is bound to the conversation the command addresses;
//! 4. the claim is verified natively;
//! 5. the family port runs.
//!
//! Steps 1–4 cannot produce an effect, so a malformed or unbound request costs
//! nothing and leaves no state behind. Running them here rather than in each
//! interface is what stops the CLI and the MCP from drifting in the order they
//! check things — or in what they check at all.
