//! Protocol-neutral business entry shared by the CLI and MCP.
//!
//! This crate owns the *shape* of a business request and its outcome: typed
//! command families, a normalized result and failure model, actor claims, and
//! stable operation references. It owns no protocol, no storage, no scheduler,
//! no runtime, and no platform access — the ports below are traits the native
//! application implements.
//!
//! Two rules keep the boundary honest:
//!
//! - A caller (CLI or MCP) translates its own wire shape into a command here and
//!   translates the result back. Business semantics live behind the ports.
//! - Nothing in this crate can observe which caller it is serving. If a
//!   decision needs that knowledge, it belongs in the caller or in the native
//!   verification the caller already performed.
//!
//! The tool surface is described by three more modules that follow the same
//! rule — they publish shapes and rules, never a second copy of the host's own
//! registry: [`extension`] for namespaced identity, capability descriptors and
//! the discovered-versus-required rules, [`invocation`] for what one call is
//! once authority is proved, and [`receipt`] for the machine receipts a tool
//! writes (and for the natural output that is not one).
