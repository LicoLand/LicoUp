//! The mobile entry: admission and routing for the bounded mobile surface.
//!
//! One request arrives as `{"action": …, "params": …}` — the same envelope the
//! native bridge, the generated contracts and the Dart caller already use.
//! The entry admits it against [`MOBILE_SURFACE`], routes it to the answering
//! owner through [`MobileOperationHost`], and answers an off-surface or
//! malformed request with the same bounded refusal shape the bridge's own
//! unsupported response carries.
//!
//! The entry decides *admission*, never *behaviour*. It does not open the
//! conversation store, hold custody, or settle a delivery itself; those are
//! the answering owners' operations and the port is where they are reached. A
//! host that cannot answer returns an error, and the error propagates to the
//! platform boundary that redacts it, exactly as the existing native bridge
//! lets an owner's error propagate.
//!
//! [`MOBILE_SURFACE`]: crate::surface::MOBILE_SURFACE
