//! Durable protocol delivery state for the mobile entry.
//!
//! A paired mobile client sends protected envelopes and settles them later,
//! across a disconnect. Two facts therefore have to survive the process: which
//! envelopes are already delivered, and where a reconnect may resume reading.
//! This module owns exactly those two facts as a bounded record set.
//!
//! It is deliberately not a queue and not a store. The conversation rows stay
//! in the Canonical Conversation authority and the envelope bytes stay in the
//! relay; what the ledger holds is the *identity* of an envelope the caller
//! sent (`LicoArcRelayEnvelope::envelope_id`) and its settlement state. That
//! identity is what makes a resend a no-op instead of a second delivery.
//!
//! A restored ledger is checked against the same acceptance a live one is:
//! the caller rebuilds the protocol version it persisted and the frozen
//! acceptance decides whether the record set may be used at all.
