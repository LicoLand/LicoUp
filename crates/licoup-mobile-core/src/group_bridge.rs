//! The mobile client's canonical group application path.
//!
//! The mobile chat surface does not keep a group lifecycle of its own. Its
//! ordinary chat controls dispatch the Canonical Conversation operations —
//! create, list, read, page, post a message, add and retire a membership —
//! through the same authenticated endpoint application path every other mobile
//! operation travels, and the host that owns the Conversation authority answers
//! them. There is one group authority and this module is only the client half of
//! reaching it.
//!
//! What this module adds over [`MobileEntry`] is the *delivery* half of that
//! path. A dispatched group operation is a protected envelope with an identity,
//! sent to a host that may be unreachable when its result is produced:
//!
//! * the envelope and its request are recorded before the authority is asked,
//!   so the same identity can never become a second group operation;
//! * the envelope is settled from the authority's own answer, never from a local
//!   guess about what the authority did;
//! * a reconnect re-drives exactly the envelopes still pending and resumes
//!   reading after the highest contiguously settled sequence, so it can repeat
//!   nothing already settled and skip nothing that is not.
//!
//! The re-driven envelope reaches the same authority again under the same
//! identity; the authority is the one that decides whether it is looking at a
//! new operation or at one it has already applied. This module never invents a
//! completion, and it never appends an Event itself — the Canonical
//! Conversation authority is the only writer.
