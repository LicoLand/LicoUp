//! The resource and settings facts the mobile entry reads from its own owner.
//!
//! The mobile client has no settings store of its own. What it has is the
//! bounded client resource policy — history pages, search results, state
//! quotas — and the privately written client state root, and both already
//! belong to `licoup-client-state`. This module is the mobile entry's read
//! path to them, so the surface has one place that answers "what may this
//! client hold" instead of each caller picking its own numbers.
//!
//! The state root is resolved through the shared portable data root, which the
//! platform bridge points at the app's own files directory before it
//! dispatches. Nothing here creates a directory or a file.
