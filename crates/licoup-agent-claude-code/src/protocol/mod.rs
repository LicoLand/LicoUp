//! The Claude Code CLI protocol, below the adapter port.
//!
//! This is the vendor half of the adapter: the `stream-json` wire the CLI
//! writes on its standard output, the launch identity and settings that wire
//! reports, the failure shape this Agent's parser reports, and the byte-line
//! parser that classifies one frame exactly once.
//!
//! Nothing above re-parses a frame. The parser is the sole ingress for this
//! Agent's bytes, which is what ADR-0008 states: one classification, below the
//! port, with the client reading the effects rather than the wire.
