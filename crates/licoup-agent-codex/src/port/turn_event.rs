//! The host's progressive turn-event emission, as one installed port.
//!
//! One Codex turn produces structured, redacted events as its frames arrive:
//! a message chunk, a completed message, a processed item and a failed tool
//! call. *What* the events are is this package's answer, so the kind and the
//! payload are built here; *where they go* is the host's, because the host owns
//! the consumer — a CLI `--stream-events` reader, the Flutter NDJSON transport,
//! or no consumer at all. The port is therefore one sink: the host states where
//! an event goes and never re-derives what it is.
//!
//! The port is one installed function rather than a second sink, so the package
//! never keeps a thread-local the host also keeps: a process installs
//! [`install`] once, and every event this package emits reaches the same
//! consumer the host's own emitters reach. Before installation the port is
//! fail-closed and emits nothing, which is the honest answer for a package
//! running outside the client.
