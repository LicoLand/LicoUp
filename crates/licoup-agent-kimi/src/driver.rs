//! The Kimi Code half of one ACP execution.
//!
//! Kimi Code officially exposes ACP v1 over stdio through `kimi acp`. Keeping
//! every operation on that one transport prevents a session created by one
//! protocol from being resumed through a different protocol with a misleading
//! identity, so this module declares exactly one launch and one session
//! identity and never opens a second route to the Agent.
//!
//! What is Kimi's, and therefore here: the runtime protocol identity, the
//! driver identity the transport pools and cancels by, the launch arguments,
//! the model and reasoning settings Kimi reads, and the autonomous-mode flag.
//! What is not: the ACP engine that runs them. The shared engine in
//! `licoup-agent-drivers` owns framing, capability negotiation, the session
//! lifecycle, bounded process I/O and failure projection, and it resolves this
//! Agent's frame dialect from the transport port through
//! [`crate::dialect::DRIVER_ID`] — so the engine runs a Kimi session without
//! naming Kimi, and this package describes one without reimplementing the
//! engine.
//!
//! Both entry points are fail-closed through [`crate::port::execution`]: a host
//! that installed no execution port admits nothing, so a package running outside
//! the client reports the refusal rather than starting a process.
