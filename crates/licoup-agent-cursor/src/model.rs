//! Cursor's launch and wire vocabulary, as the package's own facts.

//! The client composes the process half of a Cursor turn; *what* that process

//! prove, the effective settings one turn reports, and the result shape the
//! client's normalization reads — belongs to Cursor and lives here.
//!
//! Nothing here starts a process. [`CapabilityProbe`] is the classification of
//! the `--version`/`--help` output the host reads; the host owns the bounded
//! spawn, exactly as it owns the turn's process.
