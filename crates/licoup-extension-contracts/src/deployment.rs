//! C12: packages, the install closure, and which capability belongs where.
//!
//! Three separate things are decided here, and confusing them is how a "small
//! core" turns back into one large bundle:
//!
//! 1. **Ownership.** Every capability has an owner: the minimal core, or a
//!    specific package a user may leave out ([`CAPABILITY_OWNERSHIP`]). The
//!    minimal distribution carries the four core capabilities and nothing else,
//!    and it is a complete product — local chat, stop, history and basic
//!    diagnostics — without any of the others.
//! 2. **The install closure.** `requires` decides what is installed with a
//!    package; `optionalRequires` is a statement that extra capability becomes
//!    available *when the user already has it*, and never an instruction to
//!    install anything ([`install_closure`]). This relation is a deployment
//!    relation and nothing else: it does not enter a development task graph.
//! 3. **Availability.** Available, installed, enabled and active are four
//!    independent facts, and a capability that is missing is reported as an
//!    unavailable capability with a real next step — not as a malformed request,
//!    and not as a failure of the client ([`CapabilityAvailability`]).
//!
//! Nothing here reaches the network. A package the user built, a directory on
//! this machine, an official directory and a third-party mirror are all just
//! sources ([`PackageSource`]), and no resolution needs an account. A hosted
//! catalog is a convenience, never a prerequisite.
