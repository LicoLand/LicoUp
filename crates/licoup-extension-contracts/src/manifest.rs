//! C09 and C12: the package manifest — what a package says about itself.
//!
//! A manifest is a claim. It describes an identity, the profiles it serves, how
//! it is carried, what it asks the host for, and what it contributes. Two things
//! it can never do are declare itself trustworthy and declare itself authorized:
//!
//! - **It carries no digest and no signature.** The content hash and publisher
//!   verification are produced by packaging and by the update mechanism, from the
//!   bytes. A manifest that writes its own hash is describing itself with a value
//!   that could not have been computed yet, and one that claims it "has been
//!   verified" is asking the reader to skip the check
//!   ([`PackageManifest::from_value`] refuses both).
//! - **A permission request is a request.** There is no `granted` field, and the
//!   host's decision is made elsewhere and is not data in here — the same split
//!   [`CapabilityDescriptor`](licoup_application::CapabilityDescriptor) uses.
//!
//! `requires` and `optionalRequires` are *deployment* relations. They decide
//! which packages are installed together, and nothing about the development task
//! that produced them: a task that changes a package makes the evidence of the
//! tasks that touch its closure stale, and that closure is computed from these
//! two lists rather than from a task graph.
//!
//! `compatibility` is a third, separate claim: the client versions the package
//! itself says it supports ([`Compatibility`]). It is not `hostProtocol` — that
//! is the *wire* contract range, negotiated per connection — and it is not the
//! package's own version: a package version that differs from the client is not
//! itself a refusal. The kernel loads a package only when the list covers the
//! running client, and refuses it at install and at activation when it does not.
//!
//! A fourth claim is the package's *category*. A package carried by a program
//! uses `process`, `declarative` or `service`; a package that carries data and no
//! program uses [`Runtime::Data`] and declares typed
//! [`ResourceDeclaration`]s. The two are exclusive in both directions: a data
//! runtime that names an entry, a runtime reference or any other executable field
//! is refused, and a package that declares typed resources and is also carried by
//! a program is refused, because appearance data enters the client as data. What
//! a data package may ask of the host is likewise explicit: `hostPrimitives` and
//! `hostActions` are the requirement set it may bind to, and a composition
//! component that binds a primitive or action outside that set is refused rather
//! than resolved at mount time.
