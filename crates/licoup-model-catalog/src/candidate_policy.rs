//! Non-learning candidate routing: which allowed alternative may run an
//! admitted request, and one named reason for every alternative that may not.
//!
//! A request that reaches this module has already been admitted by its owner:
//! the effective grants, the account, the scope and the cost or disclosure
//! limits were decided above the catalogue, and this module is handed the
//! alternatives those grants allow. What remains here is a catalogue question
//! — among the alternatives that are already allowed, which one may run now —
//! and the answer is a recommendation, never a permission. The rules the
//! module exists to keep:
//!
//! - **Only allowed alternatives are considered.** [`CandidateRequest::allowed`]
//!   is the admission owner's answer. A candidate absent from it is never
//!   ranked, never substituted and never returned, whatever facts exist for
//!   it. A recommendation therefore cannot widen execution authority, and a
//!   disallowed candidate can never be reached by a silent fallback: the
//!   preferred candidates the grants did not allow are reported back in
//!   [`CandidateDecision::disallowed_preference`].
//! - **A preference orders, it does not authorise.** The configured choice and
//!   the configured substitute path are read as an order over the allowed set,
//!   not as entries into it. When the explicit choice cannot run and a
//!   substitute is selected, the decision says so in
//!   [`CandidateDecision::substitute_for`].
//! - **Unknown is never consent.** A requirement nothing establishes, a
//!   credential the host cannot confirm, or a model no live source reported is
//!   excluded under its own name rather than read as satisfied, present or
//!   available. Nothing here fabricates availability, a credential or a
//!   capability.
//! - **Nothing is guessed.** Capability, model, credential and quota facts
//!   arrive through [`CandidatePolicyPort`]. This module owns no readiness
//!   rule, no provider table and no budget: a host that composes no owner
//!   answers [`CandidatePolicyPort::unavailable`] and selects nothing.
//! - **The order is deterministic.** The surviving candidates are ranked by the
//!   declared order first and by the stable identity tuple last, so two runs
//!   over the same facts return the same answer, and equally preferred
//!   candidates never depend on insertion order.
//!
//! Rejections are reported as one exclusion per candidate, chosen by a fixed
//! precedence: the request's requirements in declared order, then the
//! catalogue's observation, then the credential, then the quota window. A
//! candidate is never left out silently, and an admitted request whose every
//! candidate was excluded returns
//! [`CandidateUnavailable::EveryCandidateExcluded`] with the distinct codes
//! that produced it.
