//! What can be selected, kept apart from what may run now.
//!
//! One Agent name can be in several states at the same time, and this module
//! exists so they are never collapsed into one label:
//!
//! - **support** — is this Agent/provider/model combination usable at all on
//!   this host? A declared identity is supported; a model this host observed
//!   under an Agent the host cannot execute is not; a name nothing declares is
//!   unknown rather than unsupported, because "no declaration" is not a denial.
//! - **availability** — has a live source on this machine reported the model,
//!   and when? Absence of an observation is `Unobserved`: an observation that
//!   could not be taken is never read as "nothing there".
//! - **credentials** — does this host hold a usable credential for the serving
//!   provider? This is read from [`crate::port::CredentialState`] and keeps its
//!   three-valued answer: a host that cannot establish a credential reports
//!   `Unknown`, never `Absent`.
//! - **execution** — may this Agent run under the *effective* policy for one
//!   request scope, right now? Direct requests and workflow turns have separate
//!   scopes, and one Agent may legitimately be allowed in one and blocked in
//!   the other, so every outcome carries the scope it was decided for together
//!   with its own reason.
//!
//! The module judges nothing about policy. The effective admission decision is
//! owned above this crate and arrives through
//! [`crate::port::ModelCatalogPort::agent_scope_admission`]; a caller that
//! composes no owner keeps the fail-closed answer [`ScopeOutcomeState::Undetermined`],
//! which is the honest report that this host cannot say, and never `Allowed`.
//! Readiness evidence in particular is never promoted into an execution claim:
//! only an owner that states `Allowed` produces one.
//!
//! [`selection_matrix_document`] renders the whole matrix into the one JSON
//! document the desktop client reads, so the client renders these dimensions
//! instead of re-deriving a single readiness label from them.
