//! The dispatch entry's routing decision: which allowed alternative runs now,
//! asked of the catalogue's candidate policy instead of chosen ad hoc.
//!
//! A dispatch entry — a workflow callback, a delegation, a direct turn — holds
//! alternatives it could run (an Agent, a model selector and, when the request
//! names one, a serving provider). Picking the first entry of that list is not
//! a routing decision: it is insertion order wearing a decision's clothes. This
//! module is the one place such an entry asks the policy
//! ([`crate::candidate_policy::select_candidates`]) and gets
//! back a ranked recommendation with one named reason for every alternative
//! that may not run.
//!
//! Three rules belong to the policy, and this module re-derives none of them:
//!
//! - **Only allowed alternatives are considered.** The allowed set is narrowed
//!   here by the effective per-scope admission
//!   ([`crate::selection_matrix::SelectionMatrixPort`]). An Agent
//!   the admission owner did not allow for *this* scope is not in the allowed
//!   set, so it is never ranked and never reached by a fallback. A direct
//!   request and a workflow turn are separate decisions with separate outcomes.
//! - **Unknown is never consent.** An alternative the fact source establishes
//!   nothing about is reported as [`CandidateRoutingGap::NoRecordedFacts`] and
//!   is not offered: something nobody established anything about is not an
//!   eligible substitute.
//! - **Nothing here grants execution permission.** The selected alternative is
//!   a recommendation inside the allowed set. The entry still executes the work
//!   under whatever authority it already held, and the pre-effect recheck stays
//!   the gate it is.
//!
//! The facts the policy reads are owned by whoever composes the host and arrive
//! through [`install_candidate_facts`], exactly like
//! [`crate::port::install_model_catalog_port`] answers the
//! catalogue's own port. A process that installs nothing keeps every candidate
//! fact unknown, so the policy excludes every alternative and routing reports
//! an unavailable result rather than a guessed model.
