//! Canonical, host-neutral projection plan for one dispatched native send.
//!
//! The native delta stream is the sole authority for what Flutter renders.
//! This module resolves the two facts Flutter must never infer — the
//! submitted user message and the explicit interaction capability state — into
//! the exact payload vocabulary carried by the send stream. The native host
//! only composes its own capability facts and canonical turn state into an
//! [`InteractionCapability`]; everything below is vocabulary-stable so the host
//! and its protocol doubles stay aligned.
