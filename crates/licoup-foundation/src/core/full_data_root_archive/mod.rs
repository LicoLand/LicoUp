//! Full data-root capture and restore.
//!
//! One plaintext archive carries the complete logical client data root in either a
//! standard ZIP or TAR.GZ container. Native owners decide what is coherent to
//! capture; the migration tool only marshals options and prints privacy-safe
//! results. No live database is copied directly, no opaque key handle is presented
//! as a portable secret, and a partial recovery is never reported as complete.
//!
//! Layout inside the archive:
//!
//! ```text
//! licoup-data-root.json          manifest: layout, container, inventory
//! data/<relative path>           one member per captured entry
//! ```
//!
//! The manifest is written before any member so a restore can validate the declared
//! inventory before publishing anything.
