//! The local-service readiness vocabulary every serve-family adapter shares.
//!
//! Some Agents are not driven over a pipe but over a small HTTP service the
//! Agent's own program runs (`serve`). Those Agents agree on one thing: the
//! answer a capability probe produces is *which models this endpoint currently
//! offers, and which one it is on by default*. That answer is not any one
//! Agent's protocol — the model selector, the provider that carries it and the
//! catalogue they form are the same shape for every serve-family Agent — so it
//! lives here rather than in the client or in one Agent's package.
//!
//! What an Agent's package owns is how *its* documents are read into this
//! shape, and that reader is the package's own. A package returns these values;
//! the client's serve engine adopts them into its own record. Nothing here
//! names an Agent, a vendor field or a wire format.
