//! The Harness's own durable session log, read natively.
//!
//! The installed DeepSeek Harness records each session as an artifact under
//! `<harness home>/sessions/<project>/<session>/session[.vN].jsonl[.zstd]`. The
//! first row is the session header; every later row is one event with a `seq`, a
//! `time` in milliseconds and a `data` object. This module is LicoUp's own
//! reader for that format — the usage half of the client no longer starts a Node
//! worker against the vendor's persistence libraries, and the vendor's
//! libraries are not a runtime dependency of this package.
//!
//! # What this reader folds
//!
//! Usage is a property of what the model was actually asked, so the fold follows
//! the Harness's own meter:
//!
//! - `request/header` replaces the deadline's route and effort defaults. A later
//!   header does not inherit from an earlier one.
//! - `assistant/message` and `assistant/attempt` each report one attempt's
//!   usage. A settlement with no token usage at all does not erase an earlier
//!   settlement of the same attempt.
//! - `llm/retry-started` closes the attempt it names, so the retry's own
//!   settlement is counted separately rather than replacing the attempt it
//!   superseded.
//! - A row below the header's inherited prefix is a fork's copied ancestry, not
//!   consumption this session caused, so it is not counted again.
//!
//! # What this reader refuses
//!
//! The physical format is versioned and the versions are not interchangeable.
//! This reader implements [`CURRENT_FORMAT_VERSION`]; a header that declares any
//! other version is reported as
//! [`SessionReadError::UnsupportedFormatVersion`] with the version it declared,
//! so a caller can tell "this is a generation LicoUp does not read" apart from
//! "this file is not a session log". Reporting a count from a generation whose
//! schema this reader has not been written against would be a guess, and a usage
//! meter may not guess.
//!
//! The compression is a concatenated Zstandard container: one independently
//! decodable, checksummed frame per durable batch. A plain-text artifact and a
//! compressed one fold identically.
//!
//! # The external dependency this reader declares
//!
//! The session log is the vendor's artifact and its framing, versioning and
//! migration chain are owned by the vendor. LicoUp reads the generation it
//! declares here and refuses the rest explicitly; it does not claim to track a
//! format the vendor has not published.
