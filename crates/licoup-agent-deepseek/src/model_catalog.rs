//! The DeepSeek provider catalogue the installed Harness starts from.
//!
//! The Harness's own DeepSeek provider publishes an advisory model list: an
//! installation may replace it, and a deployment may configure a different
//! endpoint, but a harness started with no further configuration offers exactly
//! these rows. Reading them used to mean starting a Node process against the
//! vendor's provider library; the rows are data, so this package carries them
//! and no runtime is started to discover them.
//!
//! # The external dependency this catalogue declares
//!
//! The advisory list, its provider identity, its display names and its
//! per-model reasoning-effort advertisment belong to the DeepSeek provider
//! shipped inside the installed Harness, not to LicoUp. [`CATALOGUE_ORIGIN`]
//! names the exact vendor generation these rows were transcribed from, so a
//! reader can tell which vendor build this transcription describes rather than
//! assuming it tracks whatever is installed. An installation whose provider
//! replaced its advisory list is served by the installation's own catalogue;
//! this transcription is the one a default installation starts from.
