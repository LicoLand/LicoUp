//! The authorized-project command family.
//!
//! Nine routes, one registry: register one explicitly declared authorized
//! project, read one registered project, list the registered projects, preview
//! or apply one canonical plan document, declare one artifact input a work item
//! takes, and the three queries the declared dependency model exists for — the
//! declared inputs, the ones whose result is not materialized, and the consumers
//! a blocked producer actually blocks. Each route decodes its own arguments into
//! the shared [`licoup_application::ProjectCommand`] and runs it through the
//! single application facade, so the CLI, an authorized Agent caller and any
//! other interface reach one implementation with one refusal vocabulary.
//!
//! The registration payload is the declared identity set: project, workspace,
//! plan, authorized root, and the authority reference the caller registers
//! under. Nothing here resolves an identity from a directory.
//!
//! # Converting a source into a plan document
//!
//! `project import-preview` and `project import-apply` take the canonical plan
//! document on `--stdin-json`; an apply also takes the `--expected-revision` it
//! previewed. The caller — a person, a script or an authorized Agent — reads the
//! source under its own authorization and converts it deliberately. This owner
//! never opens, scans or parses a source document, and there is no model call
//! anywhere on this path.
//!
//! The document declares `schema` (`licoup.project-plan/v1`), `projectId`,
//! `planId`, the `source` it was read from and one or more `workItems`. Each work
//! item declares its `workItemId`, `outcome`, `acceptance` criteria, `inputs`,
//! `roles` and the `sourceAnchor` it was read from. Two properties are not
//! negotiable, and both are refusals rather than repairs:
//!
//! - **Progress is not admitted.** A `status`, `progress`, `completedAt`,
//!   `accepted` or similar field is refused by code
//!   (`project_plan_progress_not_admitted`) and by path. A run, a completion and
//!   an acceptance are established by the work owner that observed them; an
//!   import can never mark work executed or accepted.
//! - **An omission is not a deletion.** A work item the document leaves out is
//!   retained and reported as `retained`, never deleted or cancelled.
//!
//! A preview changes nothing and returns the revision an apply must expect. An
//! apply whose `--expected-revision` is not current is refused
//! (`project_plan_import_stale_apply`); re-submitting the document already
//! stored is one effect, not two. An import never starts execution and never
//! widens a directory, cost, disclosure or task grant.
//!
//! No route composes the store's location: the port resolves the durable store
//! through the layout owner that already names the client-state root, so this
//! surface never joins a directory name of its own. The client bridge family for
//! these commands is not owned here either — `PROJECT-COMMAND-COMPOSITION` owns
//! the generated bridge sides (`schemas/client_bridge/project.json`).
