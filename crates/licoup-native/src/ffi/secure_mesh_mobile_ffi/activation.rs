//! What `secure_mesh.deviceTrust.rotate|revoke|recover` do with durable evidence.
//!
//! The three lifecycle actions were stateless policy evaluators: they mutated the
//! caller's own JSON and returned a decision, so a caller who said `revoke`
//! received `"status": "revoked"` and nothing was recorded. `super::policy`'s own
//! comment states why it cannot be more than that — it receives caller-controlled
//! JSON and so cannot establish a trust root (`policy.rs:38-40`).
//!
//! This module is the missing half. It writes the durable activation or
//! revocation through [`SecureMeshDeviceActivationStore`], and the policy result
//! the caller sees is then decided *from that ledger* rather than from the
//! request:
//!
//! * a lifecycle request that carries no durable evidence writes nothing and
//!   keeps the policy result it always had, so the existing command surface and
//!   its responses are unchanged;
//! * a lifecycle request that carries durable evidence is written first, and only
//!   a write that really happened turns the destination `active` (a rotation or a
//!   recovery) or `revoked` (a revocation). The reported state is read back from
//!   the ledger, so it cannot disagree with what was persisted;
//! * a refused write is reported with its own stable code and a refusal reason,
//!   and the caller's own request is never echoed back as the answer.
//!
//! # What this does and does not verify
//!
//! The store checks the evidence against the ledger it holds: the epoch only
//! advances, a destination that is already active is never replaced in, an
//! activation never names its own source as its destination, and the state is
//! projection-consistent with the row written beside it. Cryptographic
//! verification of the signed transition and the possession proof belongs to the
//! pinned SDK, reached through
//! `licoup_native::domain::mobile_relay::endpoint_ports::admit_replacement`.
//! A lifecycle call therefore records a decision an authorized flow already
//! reached; it is not itself a verifier, and the record it writes says which
//! authority state it descends from so that verification can be re-driven.
