//! The optional endpoint collaboration package, as the kernel resolves it.
//!
//! `org.licoland.feature.endpoint-collaboration` owns paired-device pairing,
//! secure mesh relay delivery and remote work control. The kernel owns custody,
//! durable state, the Canonical Conversation and authority, so the package is
//! never a prerequisite for the local client: this module answers whether the
//! capability is installed, switched on and declaring what it claims, and it
//! refuses outbound endpoint traffic while it is not.
//!
//! Three rules this owner exists to hold:
//!
//! * **Absent and disabled are different answers from "as before".** A caller
//!   that receives one of them reports it; it does not fall back to a bundled
//!   neighbour or to the kernel's own pre-package path.
//! * **Disable cuts outbound capability.** The gate below is consulted at the
//!   outbound transport entries in [`crate::domain::mobile_relay`], so a disabled
//!   or uninstalled package refuses the send instead of leaving a path that only
//!   a user interface stops showing.
//! * **An uninstalled package is not a broken store.** A store that cannot be
//!   read resolves as [`EndpointCollaborationAvailability::Unreadable`] and fails
//!   closed, and it is never reported as an uninstalled package.
//!
//! The package's own vocabulary and payload live in
//! `components/endpoint-collaboration`, which is its own workspace and its own
//! artifact: this kernel declares no cargo edge to it, so the installed bytes a
//! build ships and the kernel that gates on them stay separable, and the kernel
//! reaches the package only through its installed manifest and this gate. A build
//! that carries no package reports
//! [`EndpointOutboundAuthority::LegacyInKernel`] for the kernel's own pre-package
//! path, which is what is actually running.
