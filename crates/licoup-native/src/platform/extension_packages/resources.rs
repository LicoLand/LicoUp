//! Two operations that look alike and must never be one.
//!
//! **Selection** is the user's preference: which installed theme, layout,
//! style, font, language or composition this client serves. It moves a
//! presentation binding and nothing else, so it stays available while unrelated
//! work runs — including a project turn with admitted work in flight. Waiting
//! for a host-wide idle to change a font would be exactly the "new all-project
//! idle rule for a cosmetic choice" the appearance work is required not to
//! introduce.
//!
//! **A package generation entering served state** is an update: bytes that were
//! prepared at one generation become what this host serves, which is state
//! admitted work is already reading. It happens through one guarded path,
//! [`ResourceHost::begin_replacement`], which closes new-work admission *before*
//! anything may be published and refuses while this host still owns unfinished
//! work. There is no unguarded variant of the same mutation for an
//! update-switch interleaving to reach.
//!
//! Three rules are enforced by construction rather than described:
//!
//! 1. **Nothing is published before admission closes.** The only value that can
//!    publish a generation is a [`GenerationReplacement`], and the only way to
//!    obtain one is [`ResourceHost::begin_replacement`], which asks the
//!    admission question first. "Publish, then close admission" is not a
//!    representable call order.
//! 2. **One snapshot serves one set of bindings.** [`ResourceBindings`] carries
//!    every kind's binding in a single immutable value behind one `Arc`, so a
//!    refused switch leaves the value it refused to replace exactly as it was
//!    and no reader can observe half of a replacement.
//! 3. **A binding always resolves to something.** A resource that is disabled,
//!    uninstalled, or dropped by the next generation falls back to the declared
//!    system default for its kind ([`declared_default`]) — never to a
//!    half-applied binding — and the fallback is recorded with the resource,
//!    the package and the reason it stopped being served
//!    ([`ResourceFallback`]).
//!
//! What a fallback is *not*: the user's preference. [`ResourceHost::withdraw`]
//! keeps the selection and stops serving it, so re-enabling or reinstalling the
//! package restores the user's choice instead of silently resetting it to the
//! system default.
//!
//! # The one-line seam this owner declares
//!
//! The idle/update admission decision belongs to
//! `crate::domain::work_admission`, and the platform layer must not reach into
//! [`crate::domain`]. So this module declares the two facts it needs as the
//! port [`MaintenanceAdmission`], and the crate-root composition answers them
//! once per process, above both layers. The whole adapter is:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // crates/licoup-native/src/lib.rs, above both layers.
//! struct PackageGenerationAdmission;
//!
//! impl platform::extension_packages::MaintenanceAdmission for PackageGenerationAdmission {
//!     fn hold(&self, data_root: &std::path::Path) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
//!         domain::work_admission::hold_package_activation_admission(data_root)
//!     }
//!
//!     fn release(&self, data_root: &std::path::Path) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
//!         domain::work_admission::release_maintenance_admission(data_root)
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // and, in `install_environment_ports`:
//! platform::extension_packages::install_maintenance_admission(std::sync::Arc::new(
//!     PackageGenerationAdmission,
//! ))?;
//! ```
//!
//! Until that composition is installed, the port answers
//! [`ADMISSION_UNAVAILABLE`] and every generation switch is refused. That is the
//! fail-closed direction on purpose: a host that cannot say whether it still
//! owns unfinished work must not replace a generation underneath it.
//!
//! Persistence is deliberately out of scope here: this value owns *what is
//! served right now*, and a durable preference record is a separate owner's.
