//! The optional analytics package on the store's lifecycle: its own surface,
//! and everything an uninstall must leave alone.
//!
//! This is the component-integration evidence for the node's outcome —
//! "analytics uninstall removes only its own package resources and leaves base
//! usage, ongoing execution and the base facts intact" — and it is written so the
//! boundary is visible:
//!
//! - **The package installed is the package the release tool packages.** The
//!   archive is built from `components/analytics/package` — the committed
//!   manifest, release declaration, contribution resource and native entry — and
//!   installed through the production [`PackageStore`]. The one field the archive
//!   adapts is the client line, which must cover the client running the test.
//! - **The base facts are the kernel's and live outside the store.** A usage
//!   journal and a run record are written to a separate data home before the
//!   install; the uninstall is asserted to leave them byte for byte.
//! - **Ongoing execution is another package's.** The base execution instance
//!   keeps running, keeps its admission and keeps its in-flight work while
//!   analytics is drained and its bytes reclaimed.
//! - **The report claims only owned resources.** The released set is the
//!   package's own declaration exactly: its panel and its runtime entry. A
//!   resource of another package — or of the kernel — is refused, not reported.
//!
//! Everything is synthetic; no account, ledger, network or real user
//! installation is touched.
