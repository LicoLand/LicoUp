//! The declared surface of one installed optional package — and the uninstall
//! that may only ever claim it.
//!
//! The store in [`super::install`] owns bytes, records, staging and the install
//! journal; it deliberately knows nothing about what a package *is*. This module
//! closes that gap from the package's own manifest, which is the only document
//! that says what it contributes and how it is carried:
//!
//! - [`PackageSurface::register`] reads the manifest the store actually
//!   installed and turns it into the resources that package holds: one entry per
//!   declared interface contribution, and its process runtime when it declares
//!   one.
//! - [`PackageSurface::release`] releases a resource **only** when that manifest
//!   declared it. An identity the package did not declare is refused
//!   (`package_surface_resource_not_owned`), and one it declared but already
//!   released is refused separately (`package_surface_resource_released`). A
//!   package therefore cannot claim completion for another package's
//!   contribution, for a page the user closed, or for the kernel's own ledger.
//! - [`uninstall`] runs the whole removal through the store's one transaction —
//!   withdraw admission, drain, then collect — and only then reports the surface
//!   released. There is no second installer and no second removal path: the bytes
//!   are reclaimed by [`Drained::collect`], the same call the package screen uses.
//!
//! Two facts stay outside this module on purpose. The kernel's usage facts, its
//! running work and its journal are not resources any package declares, so no
//! report produced here can name them; and closing a surface
//! ([`close_surface`](super::close_surface)) is not an uninstall, so it releases
//! nothing.
