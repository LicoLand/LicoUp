//! Compatibility and availability: which package serves which Agent version,
//! and what the client remembers about it.
//!
//! Four facts are kept apart on purpose, because collapsing any two of them is
//! how "not installed" starts being drawn as a green checkmark:
//!
//! 1. **A package declares its own client compatibility list.** The list is read
//!    from the manifest the host holds ([`DeclaredPackageSource`]) and never
//!    restated here: the entries in a [`CompatibilityRow`] are the manifest's
//!    own, and the coverage decision delegates to
//!    [`licoup_extension_contracts::manifest::Compatibility::covers`], so this
//!    module cannot drift from the contract that decides it. The package's own
//!    version takes no part in that decision, which is what admits a package
//!    released on its own schedule.
//! 2. **The Agent-version interval is declared data.** One
//!    [`StrategyDeclaration`] says which first-party capability one package
//!    serves, and over which Agent versions — a half-open interval, inclusive
//!    start and exclusive end, so two adjacent rows cannot both claim the
//!    boundary version. The same capability may be declared for several packages
//!    and several intervals; the table is the whole declaration, exposed to
//!    callers as [`CompatibilityRow`] data.
//! 3. **Availability is cached by Agent version.** One record per Agent identity
//!    holds the Agent version that was observed, the capability that was asked
//!    about, the client version it was decided against, the package version that
//!    covers all three, and when that was seen
//!    ([`AvailabilityRecord`]). A request reads that record and nothing else: not
//!    a manifest, not a package directory, and nothing outside the cache
//!    ([`AvailabilityIndex::cached`]). A record decided for another Agent
//!    version is stale and is never reused; it is replaced by a fresh decision,
//!    and the Agent is named when that happens ([`AgentChange`],
//!    [`PackageOffer`]).
//! 4. **Nothing here starts an Agent.** The Agent's version is handed in by a
//!    caller that already observed it — a session handshake, a catalogue entry,
//!    a file the Agent wrote. This module has no process API at all, so
//!    "availability" can never mean "we ran it to find out": an unknown Agent
//!    stays unknown, and an unavailable capability stays unavailable.
//!
//! The offer is a recommendation, exactly like a discovery match: accepting it
//! records an install intent ([`PendingInstall`]) and installing nothing,
//! declining it records the refusal, and neither changes what the cache or the
//! installed packages say. A capability with no package behind it is reported as
//! an unavailable capability in the extension contracts' own vocabulary
//! ([`CapabilityAvailability`]), with the Agent, its version and the reason.
//!
//! This module owns the library, not a route: no FFI command, no stdio frame and
//! no bridge DTO is added here. The node that owns the host surface adds the one
//! line that uses it — `AvailabilityIndex::observe(&observation, capability,
//! client_version)` after an install, an update or a detection, and
//! `AvailabilityIndex::cached(...)` on the read path — against the owners
//! re-exported from [`super`]. Everything those calls need is already public
//! here, so wiring them changes nothing in this file.
