//! Uninstall as an ordered transaction: withdraw, drain, then reclaim.
//!
//! The order is the whole feature, so it is the type rather than a comment:
//!
//! 1. [`UninstallTransaction::begin`] closes admission on every instance of the
//!    package. Instances keep running their admitted work; they simply stop
//!    taking new work. Nothing is killed here.
//! 2. [`UninstallTransaction::drain`] moves them to `Draining` and then to
//!    `Stopped`. A caller either waits for in-flight work ([`RemainingWork::Wait`])
//!    or cancels it ([`RemainingWork::Cancel`]) — cancelling records the outcome
//!    as `Unknown` and never re-dispatches it.
//! 3. Only a [`Drained`] value can [`Drained::collect`], and it
//!    refuses if any instance of the package is still running. There is no path
//!    from `begin` to `collect` that skips the drain, so "uninstall while a
//!    generation is still serving" is not representable.
//!
//! What uninstall does **not** do is as important:
//!
//! - It removes the selected package only. A package other packages depend on is
//!   reported with its dependents and refused until the user decides what happens
//!   to them; there is no silent cascade.
//! - It removes this module's managed bytes only. History, credentials and
//!   protocol state survive, and clearing them is a separate explicit operation
//!   ([`purge_user_data`]).
//! - It never removes an interpreter or tool the user installed themselves
//!   (`user:` runtime references belong to the user), and a shared runtime another
//!   package still uses is retained rather than deleted.
//! - Closing a page is not uninstalling a package: [`close_surface`] touches
//!   neither the package nor its instances.
