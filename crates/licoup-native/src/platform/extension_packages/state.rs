//! The two state machines, kept apart.
//!
//! [`PackageMachine`] is about *bytes on disk and trust in them*: which version
//! of a package this client holds, how far the install got, and whether the user
//! has it switched on. [`InstanceMachine`] is about *one running thing*: a
//! package version may produce several instances with different permissions, and
//! an instance outlives neither its admission nor its in-flight work silently.
//!
//! The four facts that must never be collapsed into one "version" live in
//! [`InstanceIdentity`]: the package version, the instance id, the generation and
//! the registry epoch. A package update moves the generation and is committed as
//! a new registry epoch; it does not move an already admitted instance's release
//! identity, because that instance still has to be observed, cancelled and
//! settled exactly where it was admitted.
