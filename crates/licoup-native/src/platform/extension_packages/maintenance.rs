//! The one seam every mutating maintenance operation passes through.
//!
//! Replacing an installed version, or activating one, changes state that running
//! work is reading. The decision that no such work is in flight belongs to one
//! owner: `UPDATE-IDLE-ADMISSION` composes the native idle guard from the
//! canonical execution and process owners and publishes the real verdict. This
//! module is the seam: it maps that verdict into the stable refusals this surface
//! publishes, and nothing else.
//!
//! - There is exactly one way to obtain a [`MaintenancePermit`]: ask
//!   [`PackageMaintenanceAdmission::admit`]. Its field is private, so no caller can
//!   construct one, and no route can hand itself permission.
//! - The verdict arrives as data, read for the data root the operation would
//!   change. A decision nobody read is a refusal — never an assumed idle host.
//! - Read-only work never comes here at all. Checking for an update and reading
//!   the catalogue are not mutations and are not gated.
//!
//! # Why the verdict is a parameter
//!
//! The guard's decision lives in the domain layer and the package store lives
//! here, and this layer does not reach into that one. The composition that knows
//! both — the native command surface — reads the guard for the data home a route
//! was given and hands the verdict in, exactly as the guard's own module
//! describes installing an answer at the composition point. The seam still owns
//! every refusal code, so a caller cannot publish its own vocabulary for a
//! decision it did not make.
//!
//! Asking is not holding. [`PackageMaintenanceAdmission::admit`] answers whether the
//! operation may proceed; the caller that actually changes installed state takes
//! the durable close-admission barrier itself through the guard's own entry
//! (`hold_package_activation_admission`) and releases it on success or abort.
//! Keeping the two apart is what lets a read-only preview ask the same question a
//! mutating route asks without closing admission for a host that was never going
//! to be changed.
