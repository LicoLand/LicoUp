//! Install as a transaction: stage, verify, publish, and never half-publish.
//!
//! The shape of one install is fixed by the plan (§6 of EXTENSION-PLATFORM.md)
//! and by what a crash can do to it:
//!
//! 1. **Nothing is fetched here.** The host's fetcher hands in the bytes it got
//!    and the trust record they were fetched against; this module has no
//!    client, opens no socket, and cannot be made to reach a directory.
//! 2. **The bytes are checked against the trust before they are written.** A
//!    digest that does not match the record is refused with the content never
//!    leaving memory, and a permission the record does not cover is refused
//!    before the package exists.
//! 3. **Expansion happens in a staging directory, and publication is one
//!    rename.** The active directory is only ever touched by `rename`, so a
//!    failure — including this process dying — leaves the installed version
//!    exactly as it was and an abandoned stage for [`PackageStore::recover`].
//! 4. **No install script is run.** Scripts a package ships are recorded in its
//!    install record so a user can see them; there is no executor on this path,
//!    and [`InstallOutcome::processes_spawned`] is zero by construction.
//!
//! Enabled is not active: an install decides availability. Which instances
//! start, and when, is decided later and per instance.
