//! The native Agent parser family: the per-Agent parsers this host still holds,
//! and the composition that injects them — and the Agent packages that own the
//! moved ones — into the adapter SDK.
//!
//! `licoup-agent-adapter-sdk` is the single authority for what every adapter
//! program shares: the byte-line ingress contract, the adapter declaration, the
//! closed transition vocabulary and its arrival-ordered reducer, the
//! delta/cumulative text reconciliation, the process-local driver registry, the
//! registry lookup, the recorded-transcript replay harness and the parser
//! lifecycle machine. None of that is here any more, and none of it is
//! duplicated here.
//!
//! What is here is one Agent each. `adapters` holds the composition's own
//! declarations — the `REGISTRATIONS` list that names every Agent's declaration,
//! all thirteen of them the moved packages' own registrations; `replay` holds
//! the arm that drives each of them from a
//! recorded transcript and the corpus checks that belong to the family; and
//! `tests` holds the family's own claims. Each per-Agent subtree and its arm
//! move to that Agent's crate (`licoup-agent-<agent>`); this root and the
//! composition are what remain, because they are what names thirteen parsers
//! and, later, thirteen crates. Thirteen subtrees have moved — Antigravity's,
//! Claude Code's, Codex's, Copilot's, Cursor's, DeepSeek Harness', Hermes',
//! Kilo Code's, Kimi Code's, Lico Agent's, OpenClaw's, OpenCode's and Pi's:
//! their parsers are reached through the packages that own them and no copy
//! stays here.
//!
//! The SDK's two protocol-agnostic `port::ParserRegistration` queries are
//! answered in `adapters::REGISTRATIONS` by the Agents whose facts a reader
//! actually reaches: Hermes answers `execution_transitions` from its own
//! package, because it reports no transition list of its own and the host's
//! Hermes normalization reads that query; the Agents the Subagent mesh
//! dispatches — Antigravity, Claude Code, Codex and Cursor from their own
//! packages — answer `valid_identity` from their own recorded evidence; and
//! a package entry answers both queries from the package's wire vocabulary.
//! Every other entry leaves `execution_transitions` unanswered because its
//! driver carries the parser's own transition list, and the identity query stays
//! fail-closed for an Agent the mesh never dispatches. No entry inherits a
//! neighbouring Agent's answer.
