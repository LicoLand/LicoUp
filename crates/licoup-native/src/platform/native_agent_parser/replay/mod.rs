//! The replay arms this host composes, and the corpus checks that drive them.
//!
//! `licoup-agent-adapter-sdk` owns the shared replay harness — corpus
//! resolution, the recorded-frame model, the fail-closed properties and the
//! projection comparison. This tree owns the arms: one per Agent, each
//! constructing the same parser that Agent's production driver constructs.
//!
//! The arms are compiled for the test build only, exactly as they were before
//! the SDK split, because the harness is a test surface and a production build
//! calls no arm. The checks below are the family's own: they are a claim about
//! the composition of the thirteen parsers, so they live where both halves —
//! the parsers and the corpus — are in view, and they keep the crate-test paths
//! the fixture tools filter on.
