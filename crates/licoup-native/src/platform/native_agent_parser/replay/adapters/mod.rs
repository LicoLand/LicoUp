//! One replay arm per Agent parser this host composes.
//!
//! Each arm is the only place that knows how to construct that Agent's real
//! parser. An Agent whose parser has moved into its own package also moved the
//! arm that drives it, because an arm is only meaningful beside the parser it
//! constructs; this composition reaches it through the SDK's parser-set port.
//! Twelve Agents' arms have moved that way — Antigravity, Claude Code, Codex,
//! Copilot, Cursor, DeepSeek Harness, Hermes, Kilo Code, Kimi Code, Lico Agent,
//! OpenClaw and OpenCode — so each is built by the package that owns its parser.
//!
//! The arms are `pub(in crate::platform)` to this module's parent — it is the
//! only reader, and it hands them to the SDK's harness through the parser set.
