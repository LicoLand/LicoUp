//! Replay arm for the `antigravity` adapter.
//!
//! This adapter has no line parser. Its real boundary is the three entries the
//! driver calls directly: the vendor Stop-hook receipt reader
//! (`parse_hook_receipt`), the PTY stdout parser (`PtyOutputParser`), and the
//! terminal classification over the collected turn (`classify_terminal`). The
//! arm drives exactly those, so no vendor frame is re-interpreted here.
//!
//! A recorded antigravity frame is one of three shapes, disambiguated in this
//! order so that no frame is skipped silently:
//!
//! 1. a hook receipt — `parse_hook_receipt` accepts the payload and yields the
//!    native conversation id, exactly as the driver reads the Stop-hook file;
//! 2. otherwise the terminal frame — the PTY lane's process outcome
//!    (`exitSuccess`, `timedOut`) together with the launch-time
//!    `requestedSession` the turn resumed on. These are the `TerminalFacts` the
//!    driver supplies from the process it supervises; they never appear on the
//!    vendor wire, so the transcript records them as the turn's terminal frame;
//! 3. otherwise the payload is raw PTY stdout, ANSI control included, fed to
//!    `PtyOutputParser::push` and accumulated until the terminal frame.
//!
//! A frame carrying both a receipt and a process outcome runs the receipt first
//! and the terminal classification second, which is the order the driver reads
//! them in. Nothing is timed or derived from the clock.
