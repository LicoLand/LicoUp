//! The real subprocess carrier: one extension, one supervised process group with
//! one honest wire.
//!
//! What one release covers is decided by the mode, and stated in the record:
//!
//! - A **restricted** instance is one forced process (`process-fork` denied), so
//!   its observed exit *is* the whole instance: the release scope is
//!   [`ReleaseScope::Instance`], the owner can be verified, and the per-process
//!   POSIX limits really bound the instance.
//! - A **trusted local** program may fork, and a descendant that leaves the
//!   group with `setsid`/`setpgid` is not reclaimed. Its release scope is
//!   [`ReleaseScope::ProcessGroup`], the release is refused as complete
//!   (`extension_isolation_descendants_unverified`), and the owner stays
//!   unverified — a reaped root and a closed pipe are never proof of absence.
//!   [`PlatformConfinement::group_escape`] reports that boundary instead of
//!   claiming a whole tree.
//!
//! This is the X2 adapter for X1's [`ExtensionCarrier`] port. It starts a real
//! program with the operating-system controls reported by
//! [`PlatformConfinement`], speaks the published C09 line protocol over the
//! process's stdin/stdout, and never reports more than it observed.
//!
//! Rules the implementation is built around, because each one is easy to get
//! subtly wrong:
//!
//! - **One exchange, one deadline.** Every request is awaited with the
//!   monotonic-clock wall bound from the envelope. Exceeding it is
//!   `unresponsive`; the carrier then tears the process group down, and the
//!   host's existing fault rule isolates only that instance.
//! - **The reader owns the bounds.** Output is counted and bounded in the host
//!   process. A frame over the negotiated bound, or total output over the
//!   envelope, is an `over-budget` fault and the offending bytes are dropped
//!   instead of buffered.
//! - **Cancellation is a request.** `agent.cancel` is forwarded and its answer
//!   is mapped to [`CancelDisposition`]. No cancel settles an invocation; only a
//!   terminal event or an observed process death can.
//! - **An unanswered call after process death is unknown.** It is reported
//!   `Unknown` and never re-sent: the wire ref only ever maps to the binding the
//!   host issued on this session.
//! - **Release needs an observed exit *and* a scope.** [`ExtensionCarrier::shutdown`]
//!   records the status `wait` produced and the scope that release really
//!   covers; a teardown without an observed wait returns a refusal, and a
//!   process-group-scoped release refuses completeness even when the exit was
//!   observed, so the host keeps its owner unverified.
//! - **Shutdown asks first, then tears down.** A runtime is given the grace
//!   window to exit on its own after `extension.shutdown`; the process group is
//!   torn down after that, which is what reclaims a descendant that still holds
//!   the stdout pipe.
//!
//! What this carrier does not do: it does not parse the extension's natural
//! output, it does not retry unknown work, and it does not decide effects. The
//! host's bindings, the instance authority and the workflow owners keep those
//! accounts.
