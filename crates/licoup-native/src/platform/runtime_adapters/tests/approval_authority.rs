//! The approval authority this host answers the ACP session transport's port
//! with.
//!
//! The transport parks a `session/request_permission` interaction and asks the
//! port whether it may be raised and fanned out; the authority behind the
//! answer is this host's Secure Mesh approval ledger. These suites prove the
//! composed host answers that port with its own authority, and that a park
//! registers and resolves through it — an uncomposed host refuses instead,
//! which is the failure this composition exists to prevent.
