//! C01 `EffectPort` shape over the existing native work-context adapters.
//!
//! This is a bridge, not an executor. Nothing here invokes an agent on its own:
//! delivery stays with the adapter that already owns it ([`EffectDispatch`]), the
//! session's writer claim stays with the existing work-context owner
//! ([`EffectSessionOwner`]), and the per-vendor capability facts come from the
//! live runtime Agent profile instead of a vendor match in code.
//!
//! Four rules are structural here rather than promised:
//!
//! * **Capabilities are negotiated, never assumed.** Every answer carries both
//!   inputs it was derived from: what the runtime Agent profile declared, and what
//!   the bound adapter's own snapshot reports. A flag the profile does not carry
//!   is reported absent, and no source may raise another one's claim. An
//!   operation whose meaning no declaration matches is absent rather than
//!   inferred from a neighbouring flag.
//! * **An unanswered capability may be attempted; a refused one is not.**
//!   `Unverified` is the absence of a live answer, not a refusal, so the request
//!   is sent and the adapter's own answer becomes the fact. `Unsupported` and
//!   `TemporarilyUnavailable` are live statements that the channel is not usable,
//!   so nothing is sent. This is what keeps a declared vendor capability
//!   reachable while an adapter that has not yet answered keeps its honesty.
//! * **A cancel is a request.** [`CancelOutcome`] has no variant meaning "the
//!   effect was cancelled"; after an accepted request the effect's state is
//!   [`EffectState::Unknown`] with [`EffectUnknownReason::CancelUnconfirmed`],
//!   because an external effect that already happened is not undone by asking it
//!   to stop. Only a fact an adapter reported can close an effect. A request
//!   whose delivery cannot be established stays unknown: a call error or an
//!   unrecognised answer is never reported as a delivery, and only a surface
//!   that established the request never left the process may report it as not
//!   reached.
//! * **An in-flight instance is never replaced.** `submit` takes the session
//!   writer claim from the owner, so a second instance for the same session is
//!   refused by the owner itself until the effect reaches a confirmed terminal
//!   fact and the caller settles it.
//!
//! The legacy Codex/Pi adapters keep their identity: this module consumes
//! `NativeWorkContextPort::negotiate` and does not rewrite an adapter into this
//! port shape. The bridge holds no session map of its own, so two bridges over
//! one owner conflict exactly like two direct callers of that owner.
