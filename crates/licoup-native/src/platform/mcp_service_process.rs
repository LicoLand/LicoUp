//! The optional MCP service process, bound to one installed package generation.
//!
//! The service is not a bundled neighbour of this executable. It is the payload
//! of the optional `org.licoland.feature.mcp` package, and this module owns the
//! binding between the package lifecycle and the process that actually runs:
//!
//! - **Resolution.** Which generation starts comes from the package store
//!   ([`crate::platform::extension_packages::select_generation`]): the highest
//!   installed version the user has switched on, with the executable entry its
//!   own manifest declares. Nothing here falls back to a file next to this
//!   binary, and an absent or switched-off package starts no process at all.
//! - **Consent.** The bytes that start are the bytes the operator approved. The
//!   install record's content digest is the approval; the entry file is measured
//!   when the generation is selected, and the program is handed that digest in
//!   [`APPROVED_DIGEST_ENV`] so the serving process can prove it is the same
//!   bytes. A digest that no longer measures the same is refused, not started.
//! - **Ownership.** Starting writes a lease that names the generation, the
//!   measured payload digest and the callers it serves. Stopping, crash
//!   recovery and removal are all answered from that lease, so a process this
//!   client started is never forgotten and a process it did not start is never
//!   claimed.
//! - **One process.** The previous generation is stopped and confirmed before
//!   the next one starts. A failed activation restores the previous lease and
//!   reports what it could and could not restart; a crash reconciles to exactly
//!   one live process on the next start.
//!
//! The state this module keeps lives beside the service's own discovery document
//! under `<data home>/client-state/subagent-mcp/`; the process itself stays owned
//! by the payload's `service start|stop|status` verbs, which are the only things
//! that can prove the service's writer lease drained.
//!
//! SEAM(PIPELINE-COMMANDS): the package command family owns install, enable,
//! disable and uninstall. It reaches this owner with one line per transition —
//! `mcp_service_process::activate(&consent)` after an enable/activate,
//! `mcp_service_process::retire()` *before* an uninstall removes the installed
//! bytes, `mcp_service_process::stop_for_data_home_transition()` where a
//! transition already calls it. No FFI route is added here.
