//! This host's composition of the adapter registry and adapter execution.
//!
//! `licoup-agent-drivers` owns the host side of Agent execution — the adapter
//! registry, the declarations as data, the dispatch admission, the execution
//! normalization, the Subagent MCP mesh and the work-context seam — and
//! declares the ports it reads every Agent and its own lanes through. This
//! module is the composition above it: it answers those ports with the
//! implementations this host has today, and it keeps every former
//! `platform::runtime_adapters` path reachable through the re-exports below.
//!
//! What it answers, and where each answer travels next:
//!
//! * the thirteen per-Agent driver halves — probe, execution and normalization
//!   — in [`drivers`], which move to `licoup-agent-<agent>` when those crates
//!   exist, exactly as `platform::work_context_ports`' two halves do;
//! * this host's own conversation lane, its generic CLI fallback lane, its
//!   Subagent caller manager and its cleanup entry point, in
//!   [`crate::host_lane`], none of which is any Agent's protocol;
//! * the approval authority an ACP park is raised and fanned out against, in
//!   [`evaluate_approval_request`] and [`evaluate_approval_fanout`], which is
//!   this host's Secure Mesh approval ledger rather than anything the moved
//!   transport may name for itself;
//! * the endpoint layer's client-error projection, in [`client_error`], which
//!   travels with the endpoint crate when `ffi/` extracts.
//!
//! Nothing here restores a vendor branch to the moved crate: it names no Agent,
//! and every per-Agent fact is reached through the port.
