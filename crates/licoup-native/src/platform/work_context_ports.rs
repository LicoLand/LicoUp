//! The host's composition of the work-context seam.
//!
//! `licoup-agent-drivers` owns the seam itself — the binding contract, the
//! adapter transport, the production host driver and the C01 effect port — and
//! declares the port it reads every Agent and the host's own lane through. This
//! module is the composition above it: it answers that port with the
//! implementations this host has today, and it keeps every former
//! `platform::work_context_ports` path reachable through the re-exports below.
//!
//! What it answers the port with, and where each answer travels next:
//!
//! * the Codex and Pi protocol adapters and their driver executions, in
//!   [`adapter`], which move to `licoup-agent-codex` and `licoup-agent-pi` when
//!   those crates exist;
//! * this host's own conversation lane, reached through
//!   [`crate::platform::dispatch_lane_operation`] and the Agent inventory port
//!   [`crate::target_port::agent_target_port`] composes, neither of
//!   which is any Agent's protocol.
//!
//! The hermetic work-context fixtures the integration suites drive are host
//! test material; they live here, and they travel to their Agents' crates with
//! the protocol halves they describe.
