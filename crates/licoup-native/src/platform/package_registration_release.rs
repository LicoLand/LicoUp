//! The real registration owners, behind the uninstall release seam.
//!
//! Each [`RegistrationOwner`] variant is dispatched to the module whose `remove`
//! path is authoritative for that surface. Nothing here edits another module's
//! configuration file directly: the owning module decides what its own surface
//! contains, and this adapter supplies the inputs that owner's `remove` requires.
//!
//! Two properties are deliberate:
//!
//! 1. **An owner's `remove` gets what that owner demands.** A provider MCP entry
//!    is removed through a digest-bound plan and permit against a reviewed
//!    configuration path; a Codex plugin through the Codex CLI's own removal. This
//!    adapter carries those inputs from the caller who planned the uninstall. It
//!    invents no plan, no permit, no configuration path and no executable.
//! 2. **Missing inputs refuse; they never skip.** An owner with no inputs reports
//!    [`RELEASE_INPUTS_MISSING`] naming its own module, so uninstall stops with the
//!    bytes in place instead of reporting a surface released that it never
//!    touched. A stale approval reports [`RELEASE_APPROVAL_STALE`]: the entry
//!    changed since the user approved its removal, and removing the new one under
//!    the old approval is exactly what the digest binding prevents.
