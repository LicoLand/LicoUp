//! The composition point for the model catalogue port.
//!
//! `licoup-model-catalog` owns the selection facts — declared canonical
//! identity, observed availability, recorded prices and the planning inputs
//! built on them — and declares [`ModelCatalogPort`] for every fact it reads
//! from a module composed above it. This module is where this host answers that
//! port: each member names the owner that actually holds the fact, so the
//! catalogue never refers to the Agent inventory, the driver engines or the
//! local state roots, and no reference points upward.
//!
//! It sits at the crate root, above the domain and platform layers, exactly
//! like the Agent inventory's port: answering a port is composition, not a
//! domain concern, and a domain module that reached into `crate::platform`
//! would be the coupling the layering exists to prevent.
//!
//! [`selection_matrix_port`] is the one composition function for the effective
//! execution policy, and it answers both consumers of that policy from the same
//! owner: the catalogue's client projection reads
//! [`SelectionMatrixPort::agent_scope_admission`] directly, and
//! [`install_routing_policy_owner`] installs that same admission answer together
//! with the candidate facts for the dispatch entry that routes with it. One
//! owner, one answer, so the scope outcome a client renders and the scope
//! outcome routing obeys cannot disagree.
//!
//! Two members are deliberately answered with less than a caller might wish,
//! and the difference is the point of the port:
//!
//! - **credentials.** No owner publishes a mapping from a catalogue provider id
//!   to the credential records it holds, and inventing one — matching a model
//!   or provider name against a credential label — would fabricate access. The
//!   honest answer is [`CredentialState::Unknown`] for every provider, and the
//!   candidate policy therefore excludes every alternative instead of running
//!   one whose access nothing established.
//! - **the source generation.** It is the revision of the canonical registry
//!   snapshot an observation was taken against. A host with no catalog
//!   publishes no revision, and then no observation is reused.

///   `inspect_target_read_only` reads exactly that without executing the
///   Agent's binary or touching its history store. Availability is recorded from
///   that read and timed at the read, because the catalogue's availability
///   question is *has a source on this host reported the model*, and this
///   read-only owner is such a source. A candidate whose Agent or model the
///   declaration does not carry is answered `None` — nothing on this host
///   reported it — and no model is ever synthesized from a name, a price row or
///   an intelligence score.
/// * **a credential.** No owner publishes a catalogue-provider to credential
///   mapping, so the answer stays [`CredentialState::Unknown`] rather than a
///   claim that a credential exists.
/// * **a quota window.** The local quota owner publishes per-provider windows,
///   and no mapping from a catalogue provider id to one of those windows is
///   established here; the answer stays [`QuotaState::Unknown`], which the
///   policy records without reading as exhaustion.
///
/// Requirements are answered only where the declaration establishes them, so a
/// requirement nothing establishes stays `Unknown` and the candidate is
/// excluded under its own name instead of being read as satisfying it.
