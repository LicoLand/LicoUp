//! The agent-execution port every caller above the platform layer reaches.
//!
//! One port owns execution, cancellation, steering, session resume and history
//! for every Agent, and the work-context binding the continuity host drives.
//! `licoup-agent-drivers` declares that port and owns the machines behind it;
//! this module is the composition's entry to it, so a caller names the port and
//! never the lane, the registry or an Agent's own module.
//!
//! It lives at the crate root for the same reason [`crate::target_port`] does:
//! it joins the layers once, above both, and neither layer has to know the
//! other. What answers the port today is this host's own conversation lane,
//! [`crate::platform::conversation_lane`], which is the host's control plane
//! rather than any Agent's protocol — the same lane the driver port's
//! `LaneReach` answers with, read here through one entry. When a caller needs
//! an Agent's own protocol half, it asks the driver port's per-Agent
//! registration; it never names the Agent's module.
//!
//! Every entry here is fail-closed in the same way the moved crate's ports are:
//! a host that never composed an answer reports a refusal rather than
//! inventing an effect.
