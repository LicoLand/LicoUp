//! Authorized project and plan identity: the native composition.
//!
//! `licoup-project` owns the identity model and the durable record. This module
//! owns the two facts the crate cannot know by itself: where the portable data
//! root is, and which authority the caller of a request actually holds. Both
//! answers come from owners that already exist — the foundation's data-root
//! locator and the verified actor claim the shared facade established before the
//! project port ran.
//!
//! Nothing here reads a filesystem to name a project. The store's location is
//! the only path this module opens, and the authorized root each registration
//! declares is stored as the declaration it is.
