//! The project family behind the shared `licoup_application` facade.
//!
//! One translation each way: the typed command becomes the crate owner's own
//! registration or query, and the owner's answer becomes the neutral
//! [`CommandOutcome`] both interfaces already publish. The port decides nothing
//! about identity, authority or durability — it supplies the authority answer
//! and the store, and refuses a registration the caller's own claim cannot
//! authorize before the store is reached.
//!
//! The store is opened per call, exactly as the workflow store opens its own
//! connection: a one-shot CLI process and the durable desktop host then read the
//! same rows, and a data root that is unavailable becomes a typed retryable
//! failure instead of a facade that cannot be composed.
