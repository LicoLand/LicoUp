//! One admission rule for a project directory recorded in agent history.
//!
//! Agent stores keep whatever working directory the agent happened to run in,
//! including residue from a turn that was launched against the filesystem root,
//! the home directory, or a personal media library. A local agent indexes the
//! directory it is started in, so such a value must never reach the client as a
//! conversation's project directory: binding it once makes the next turn walk
//! the whole personal tree and writes the same bad value back into the agent
//! store.
//!
//! `crate::platform::agent_workspace` owns the same rule for the send path.
//! This module is the read path applying that rule to history metadata, so both
//! directions accept exactly the same set of directories.
