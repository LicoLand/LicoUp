//! V7-R2: the native side of admission — the existing authorization owner
//! behind the boundary, and the durable scope barrier a pause writes.
//!
//! Two adapters, and no new source of truth:
//!
//! * [`StoreAuthorityAdapter`] adapts **the existing authorization owner**
//!   (`StrategyStore::{authorization_preview, grant_authorization,
//!   revoke_authorization, authorize_effect}`) into the read/recheck/permit
//!   shape C01's admission boundary needs. It resolves the grant in force,
//!   rechecks an expectation against it, and issues the one-shot effect permit
//!   through the store's own write-locked path. It adds no policy of its own:
//!   the same three conditions the store applies to a current authorization
//!   (active, the definition digest it was issued for, the semantics it was
//!   issued against) are the ones used here.
//! * [`StoreScopeBarrier`] writes the pause/stop barrier and freezes the
//!   recipients it addresses **in one transaction**, using the durable tables
//!   the controlled store already owns (`workflow_graph_state.barrier_active`,
//!   `workflow_pause_requests`, `workflow_stop_requests`). C03 requires the two
//!   facts to be one decision: a barrier without the frozen set lets a later
//!   instruction reach recipients the instruction never addressed, and a freeze
//!   without the barrier lets a new node visit start under a paused scope.
//!
//! ## Why this file does not name the runtime's port types
//!
//! The ports are declared in `licoup-workflow-runtime`
//! (`ports::{AuthorityPort, …}`, and `admission::{…}` for the boundary itself),
//! and the store side of that seam implements them. `licoup-native` carries no
//! dependency on that crate yet, so this adapter repeats the *shape* — a
//! digest-only grant reference, a recheck that answers with what moved, and a
//! one-shot permit — rather than importing it. The composition edge is V7-I1's
//! step; adding a dependency here to avoid a few method signatures would edit
//! the crate graph, which is not this leaf's to do. The meaning is deliberately
//! identical, so the first thing that can be retired is the repetition, not a
//! second interpretation of the same facts.
//!
//! ## The ordering a revocation takes effect in (C01)
//!
//! [`StoreAuthorityAdapter::permit_effect`] goes through the store's
//! `authorize_effect`, whose own contract is the linearization rule this task
//! carries: it revalidates the command and the authorization under the SQLite
//! write lock, and **a later revoke does not retroactively invalidate an
//! already-issued one-shot permit**. So a revocation stops the *next* effect —
//! [`StoreAuthorityAdapter::recheck`] then answers `NoneInForce` or `Replaced`,
//! and the next admission is refused — while the effect already admitted keeps
//! its binding and settles on its own authenticated outcome. The permit half is
//! the store's own contract, proved by
//! `effect_authorization_revalidates_digest_owner_and_live_lease` in
//! `workflow_store/store.rs` (a live lease under the current digest permits,
//! a lost lease or a stale digest does not). This adapter delegates to that
//! path and proves its own wiring of it in the tests below; it does not
//! re-implement the rule.
//!
//! ## What this file deliberately does not do
//!
//! It does not change the legacy control path: `InterventionProxy::admit` with
//! `ControlOperation::Pause` still goes through `record_admission`, which writes
//! the pause-negotiating row and *not* the graph barrier. That one statement
//! belongs to the controlled store's owner
//! (`domain/workflow_store/control.rs`), which is outside this task's write
//! scope; the barrier writer here is what the admission seam calls, and routing
//! the legacy control path through it is V7-I1's wiring step. Until then, a
//! graph pause admitted through the legacy proxy does not by itself stop a new
//! visit — a gap this module records rather than papers over.
