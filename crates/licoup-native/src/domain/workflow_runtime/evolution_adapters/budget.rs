//! Reserve and settle budget by effect id, against a durable reservation.
//!
//! The durable facts belong to
//! [`crate::domain::agent_usage::workflow_ledger`]: it owns the budget pool, the
//! reservation row and its settlement state. This adapter calls
//! `reserve_graph_command` / `settle_graph_command` / `release_graph_command`
//! with the effect id as the reservation identity and translates the answers
//! into typed admissions, settlements and releases.
//!
//! # Two connections, no pretend transaction
//!
//! The reservation is durable in the usage ledger; the workflow's started
//! marker is durable in the workflow store. Those are two SQLite connections
//! and this adapter never claims otherwise. The order is
//! *reserve → commit started → invoke → settle*, so:
//!
//! - a crash before the started marker leaves an **orphan**: nothing ran, and
//!   [`BudgetAdapter::release_orphan`] gives the amount back idempotently;
//! - a crash after it leaves an **in-doubt reservation**: the effect may have
//!   run, so the amount stays held until a settlement or reconciliation
//!   supplies usage instead of being re-allocated.
//!
//! # No configuration, no gate
//!
//! A request with no [`BudgetConfiguration`] answers
//! [`BudgetAdmission::NotConfigured`] and writes nothing at all — no pool row,
//! no reservation, no denial. An unconfigured budget must not become an
//! invented gate, and the effect's real cost is still observed by
//! [`super::observation`].
