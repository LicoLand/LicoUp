//! Persistent observation of what work actually cost.
//!
//! The durable facts belong to
//! [`crate::domain::agent_usage::workflow_ledger`]: it owns the Graph run
//! identity, the per-command usage row and its accuracy marker. This adapter
//! writes those rows through that API and reads them back as typed values.
//!
//! Three rules from the plan are enforced here rather than described:
//!
//! 1. **Every outcome is observed.** A failed, cancelled or in-doubt effect is
//!    recorded like a successful one: a call that failed after tokens were spent
//!    still cost those tokens.
//! 2. **Unknown is not zero.** A cost that was not reported, or that belongs to
//!    an effect whose external outcome is in doubt, is [`ObservedCost::Unknown`].
//!    The record sent to the ledger carries no usage sample at all, so no zero
//!    is written in place of a number nobody has.
//! 3. **Metering is not presentation.** [`ObservationAdapter::meter_run`]
//!    returns the base facts a budget or a policy may read.
//!    [`ObservationAdapter::statistics`] returns an optional projection for
//!    display or research; nothing that admits, reserves or settles work may
//!    read it, and it is allowed to be absent.
