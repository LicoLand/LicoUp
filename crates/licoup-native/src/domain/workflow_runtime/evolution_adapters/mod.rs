//! Ports from the runtime's economic consumers to the existing fact owners (V7-EC1).
//!
//! Four independent adapters, one per concern, each with its own honest missing
//! states and its own typed errors:
//!
//! - [`observation`] persists what an effect actually spent — including FAILED,
//!   CANCELLED and UNKNOWN outcomes — and keeps the base metering facts apart
//!   from the optional statistics/research projection.
//! - [`budget`] reserves and settles keyed by effect id against a durable
//!   reservation, releases an orphaned reservation idempotently, and refuses to
//!   give budget back for an effect that may already have run.
//! - [`source`] says where a number came from and what that number is allowed to
//!   authorize. An imported usage marker authorizes no budget settlement, and
//!   that is stated in the type surface rather than in a comment.
//! - [`policy`] turns real history into a suggestion for *future* work only;
//!   adopting changes the future default, revoking restores it, and neither
//!   rewrites a binding that is already in flight.
//!
//! # Ownership
//!
//! Nothing here owns a fact. The durable ledgers stay with
//! [`crate::domain::agent_usage::workflow_ledger`] (Graph usage rows, budget
//! pools and reservations), the billing facts stay with
//! [`crate::domain::provider_model_pricing`], and the observation/strategy
//! seams stay with [`crate::domain::workflow_runtime::evolution`]. These
//! adapters call those owners through their own published API and translate the
//! JSON they return into typed values; they never write a second copy of a fact
//! an owner already keeps.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not claimed
//!
//! - A reservation and the workflow's started marker live in two different
//!   SQLite connections. No adapter claims those two writes are one
//!   transaction; the durable reservation exists so that the intermediate
//!   failure leaves a releasable orphan instead.
//! - An unreadable or unreported cost is [`FactState::Unknown`], never zero.
//! - A mechanism that runs correctly is not evidence of a statistically better
//!   outcome. [`policy::EvidenceClaim`] has no "measured improvement" variant,
//!   so no suggestion can carry one.
