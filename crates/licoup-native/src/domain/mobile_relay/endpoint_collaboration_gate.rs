//! The endpoint collaboration authority check every outbound send passes.
//!
//! [`crate::platform::extension_packages::endpoint_collaboration`] resolves what
//! the host knows about the optional endpoint collaboration package, and this
//! module is the one place the sending half of
//! [`crate::domain::mobile_relay`] asks it. Nothing here opens a store, performs a
//! cryptographic operation or classifies a transport outcome: it answers whether
//! this client may emit outbound endpoint traffic at all, and refuses with the
//! owner's own stable reason when it may not.
//!
//! The check is deliberately at the send entries rather than in the user
//! interface: a disabled or uninstalled package must cut the capability, and a
//! hidden control is not a cut.
