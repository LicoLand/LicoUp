//! Inbound mapping for one verified peer unit at the native endpoint boundary.
//!
//! M12 owns the actual platform adapters and this inbound bridge. Protocol
//! decisions stay with the pinned SDK and are consumed only through
//! `licoup_protocol_bindings`, whose [`TrustFacts`] cannot be constructed: the
//! only producers are the SDK-backed `accept_handshake` and `receive_record`
//! entries, so a value of this module's [`PeerMessage`] always names a unit the
//! SDK actually verified and committed.
//!
//! Three boundaries are load-bearing:
//!
//! * Provenance is explicit and separated. The verified author, the verified
//!   device, and the carriage forwarder are three different values in
//!   [`PeerOrigin`]; a station or relay hop is carriage only and can never be
//!   read as an author, a device, or trust.
//! * A station's own report is a read-only [`StationHint`]. It is recorded as
//!   such and can never become delivery, admission, read, or acceptance
//!   evidence (`docs/protocols/licoarc-station-adapter.md`: a station
//!   acknowledgement is not endpoint evidence).
//! * Duplicate suppression and causal placement use stable identities only:
//!   the SDK's own replay identity for one protected unit, and the peer's
//!   logical message id for a re-protected resend. Local arrival order stays
//!   local; it is never rewritten into the peer's author order.
//!
//! [`TrustFacts`]: licoup_protocol_bindings::TrustFacts
