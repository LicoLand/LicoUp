//! The composition point between signed-transition verification and the binding.
//!
//! Two crates own the two halves of device replacement, and neither may name the
//! other: [`licoup_protocol_bindings`] holds the fixed-SDK delegation and may
//! reach no LicoUp crate at all
//! (`crates/licoup-protocol-bindings/tests/dependency_direction.rs:309-316`),
//! while [`licoup_endpoint_core`] holds the binding vocabulary and declares no
//! dependency. This module is where they meet, exactly as the adapters beside it
//! are where the caller-owned ports meet the SDK's own traits.
//!
//! It adds no protocol policy. The SDK alone decides whether the signed
//! transition, the possession proof and the authenticated session hold; this
//! module only compares what the SDK verified against what the caller asked for,
//! and refuses every mismatch:
//!
//! * **the credential** — the caller must really hold one of the two accepted
//!   sources. With neither, the call is refused before the SDK is reached, so
//!   ordinary backup, relay and peer input admits nothing.
//! * **replay** — a presented record must advance past the epoch already
//!   accepted, decided from the caller's own durable epoch before the SDK is
//!   reached, so a superseded roster is never re-verified into acceptance.
//! * **the subject** — the verified record's `userIdentityRef` must be the
//!   subject the binding names.
//! * **the operation** — the successor roster's device status for the
//!   destination decides whether the transition activates or revokes, and the
//!   binding's operation must be that one.
//! * **the new identity** — the destination must be a distinct endpoint the
//!   successor roster really holds at this epoch, never the source identity
//!   itself, so new endpoint keys never derive from an imported source identity.
//! * **the source device** — the successor roster must account for it, so
//!   authority that never mentions the device being replaced belongs to another
//!   replacement.
