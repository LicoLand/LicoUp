//! The base usage journal: source events, their cursors, and the facts they
//! settle into.
//!
//! The kernel owns the base usage facts (`usage-journal.v1`). Third-party
//! sources — through the C11 usage-source SDK — produce *observations*, and this
//! module is the seam where an observation becomes a durable fact in the same
//! base ledger store the graph-run reservations live in. Three rules are
//! structural here rather than conventional:
//!
//! - **A delivered event settles once.** An event is keyed by the host-bound
//!   source, epoch and observation id, and its revision and content digest are
//!   recorded with it. A replay at the same revision changes nothing; an older
//!   revision is superseded; a same-revision payload with different content is
//!   refused instead of silently rewriting a settled fact. A duplicate cursor
//!   therefore cannot double-count and cannot rewrite what it already settled.
//! - **A cursor is durable and monotonic.** The position a page returned is
//!   stored with the source and its epoch, advanced only forward and only after
//!   the page's observations settled, so a restart resumes where the journal
//!   stopped. A cursor belongs to one scope: resuming it for another is refused
//!   rather than answered with someone else's position.
//! - **Unknown stays unknown.** A reading the producer does not know is stored
//!   with no number at all, and a metric the producer did not send has no fact.
//!   Neither becomes zero, because zero is a claim that nothing happened.
//!
//! The facts are the kernel's and stay here. [`MeteringFactPort`] is the narrow
//! slice an optional package borrows; the host composes it, and a client without
//! that package records, reads and settles exactly the same facts.
//! [`UsageSourcePort`] is the host's collection seam: push, bounded pull and the
//! cursor that resumes. Deduplication across several sources of one call is the
//! host's fact too: when it issues a measurement, every report of that
//! measurement settles into one fact instead of one per source.
