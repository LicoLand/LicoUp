//! Vendor artifact acquisition for the `official-artifact` channels.
//!
//! Acquisition is the half of an Agent Hub lifecycle that turns the recipe's
//! declared official source into staged bytes. It never installs: the staged
//! file is the input of the install argv that [`super::engine`] runs, and it is
//! written only under the Hub's private staging root.
//!
//! Two rules are deliberate:
//!
//! * Every fetch is bounded, and its origin is pinned per request. The URL is
//!   built from the recipe's own `url_template`, the scheme is HTTPS and the
//!   first request must belong to the declared `origin_host`. A later redirect
//!   hop must belong to that origin too, or to a host the same recipe names in
//!   `redirect_hosts`; a hop anywhere else is refused. The redirect declaration
//!   exists because a vendor that hands its own downloads to a content network
//!   answers the first request with a `Location` on that network — GitHub
//!   release assets move to `release-assets.githubusercontent.com` — so a
//!   single origin can never describe the vendor's own publication. It widens
//!   redirect hops only: it cannot serve the first request, it is validated when
//!   the registry loads, and it is explicit per recipe, so no host becomes
//!   reachable for a channel that did not declare it. A loopback origin is
//!   accepted so the real fetch path can be exercised against a local fixture
//!   server; a bundled recipe never declares one.
//! * Integrity fails closed. A channel whose artifact declaration carries no
//!   published digest is refused with [`AcquisitionFailure::IntegrityUndeclared`]
//!   instead of staging unverified vendor bytes.
//!
//! Failures that the lifecycle reports to the caller carry a stable code in
//! [`AcquisitionFailure::code`].
