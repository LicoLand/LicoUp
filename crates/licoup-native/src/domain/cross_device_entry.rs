//! The cross-device production entry.
//!
//! Three things already existed in this host with no production caller: the
//! caller-owned port spine [`ProtocolWorkSetup`], the verified-unit mapping in
//! [`endpoint_transport`](crate::domain::mobile_relay::endpoint_transport), and
//! the conversation admission in
//! [`PeerIngress`](crate::domain::client_conversation::peer_ingress::PeerIngress).
//! Each was reachable only from its own module's fixtures. This module is the
//! entry that joins them once, so the native route, the composition root, and
//! the device layer call one owner instead of three loose types.
//!
//! # The two constraints this entry exists to hold
//!
//! **The verification record precedes the conversation row.** One inbound unit
//! is recorded as a [`VerificationRecord`] first; only a unit whose record is
//! already in the ledger can be written into the Canonical Conversation. The
//! order is not bookkeeping: a crash between the two leaves a recorded
//! verification with no row, which is re-drivable, while a row with no recorded
//! verification is a message no verified unit stands behind.
//!
//! **A replay is never admitted again.** The ledger is keyed by the SDK's own
//! replay identity, so a byte-identical replay of one committed protected record
//! is refused before any conversation write. A re-protected resend of the same
//! logical message carries a different replay identity, so it reaches the
//! ingress and merges there as a duplicate instead of becoming a second row.
//!
//! Both constraints are falsifiable from the public surface of this module; the
//! integration suite drives them, and the mutations that invert the order or
//! remove the identity check fail it.
//!
//! # What this entry deliberately does not do
//!
//! It creates no conversation, no principal, no membership, and no
//! administrator; the binding table below only resolves a verified device to a
//! membership that already exists. It executes no effect: a structured command
//! request leaves as an [`PeerEffectIntent`](crate::domain::client_conversation::peer_ingress::PeerEffectIntent)
//! for the single-owner application entry.
//!
//! [`ProtocolWorkSetup`] is admitted through [`admit_protocol_work`], which adds
//! no policy: the pinned SDK decides whether the supplied artifact is the fixed
//! Candidate this build integrates, and a refusal returns every port untouched.
