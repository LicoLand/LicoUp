//! Host-owned binding from a verified peer device to an existing membership.
//!
//! This port is deliberately small and one-directional. The ingress asks the
//! host which pre-existing Conversation membership a verified author/device pair
//! belongs to; the host answers from its durable trust state, and an absent
//! answer is a refusal. Nothing in the ingress creates a principal, a
//! membership, or an administrator, and a message can never name its own
//! binding.
