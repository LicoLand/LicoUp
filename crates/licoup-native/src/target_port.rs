//! The composition point for the Agent inventory port.
//!
//! `licoup-agent-targets` owns the declarations and declares
//! [`AgentTargetPort`] for every fact it reads from a module composed above it.
//! This module is where this host answers that port: each member names the
//! owner that actually holds the fact, so the inventory crate never refers to
//! the driver engines, the model facts, the conversation state or the local
//! model gateway, and no reference points upward.
//!
//! It sits at the crate root, above the domain and platform layers, exactly
//! like the environment-port and product-version bindings: answering the port
//! is composition, not a domain concern, and a domain module that reached into
//! `crate::platform` would be the coupling the layering exists to prevent.
//!
//! `agreement_with_the_declarations` below is the other half of that split.
//! The inventory's thirteen declarations and the engines' packaged adapters are
//! one set, and the check that they stay one-to-one needs both halves in view,
//! which is exactly what composition is. It used to live inside the inventory
//! as a direct call into the driver registry; it cannot live there any more
//! without the reference pointing upward, and it is a claim about the
//! composition rather than about either half alone.
