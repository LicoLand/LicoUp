# LicoUp Guide

Complete the user's requested LicoUp operation through the available interfaces.
For a direct reply, answer directly. Read the current tool schemas before an
operation; do not infer an unavailable capability from this guide.

| Operation | Route |
| --- | --- |
| Find an available Agent | `lico_subagents_list`, then `lico_subagent_probe` for the selected target |
| Inspect the designated Assistant's current Membership Profiles | `lico_assistant_profiles` |
| Delegate bounded work or continue an existing delegation | `lico_subagent_delegate` or `lico_subagent_continue`, using the exact active `conversationId + membershipId` |
| Run coordinated work as the designated Assistant | Prepare the needed Graph and bindings, then use `lico_assistant_workflow_execute` within existing authorization |
| Observe a workflow | `lico_assistant_workflow_inspect`; reuse its run identity |
| Stop work at the user's request | `lico_subagent_cancel` or `lico_assistant_workflow_cancel` for the exact target or run |

Keep the designated Assistant and current Conversation. Never self-call,
cross a Conversation boundary, invent Memberships, or substitute native session
identifiers for LicoUp identities. Pass only the task context a target needs.
Report completed work and relevant failures through the owning Conversation.
An elapsed observation window does not prove failure or authorize cancellation.

A tool or Skill grants no new authority. Preserve the user's intent, host
permissions, protected-key authentication, and production, publication,
private-data transfer, and irreversible-action boundaries. Native sessions,
paths, endpoints, credentials, prompts, Agent output, and backend runtime data
remain private to LicoUp. Share only the minimum authorized result.
