//! The port the host's adapter registry and adapter execution read one Agent
//! through.
//!
//! This tree owns the host side of Agent execution: which packaged adapters
//! exist, what each of them declares, how a turn is admitted and dispatched,
//! and how an Agent's own report is normalized into this host's execution
//! vocabulary. It owns no Agent's protocol. Everything it needs *about* one
//! Agent — that Agent's driver identity, the protocol name its driver speaks,
//! how its executable is probed, how one of its turns is executed, and whether
//! a durable native identity is valid for it — arrives through
//! [`AgentDriverRegistration`], and the composition above this crate supplies
//! the registrations: `licoup-native` while the Agent crates do not exist,
//! `licoup-agent-<agent>` once they do.
//!
//! The same shape is used one layer down by `licoup-agent-adapter-sdk`, whose
//! `AdapterParserSet` carries one `ParserRegistration` per Agent. A registration
//! here embeds that registration rather than declaring a second one, so an
//! Agent has exactly one declaration and one set of protocol-agnostic answers.
//!
//! Every member is a `fn` pointer rather than a trait, so the host keeps no
//! state a caller did not hand it, and no vendor name is compiled into this
//! crate. The composition is installed once, by [`install`]; a build that
//! installs nothing answers fail-closed rather than inheriting a guess.
