//! Replay arms for the ACP adapters that share this protocol state machine.
//!
//! The reducer is module-private here, so the arm lives with it rather than in
//! any Agent's tree. Every ACP adapter replays the same real `AcpProtocol`; the
//! frame dialect it reads is resolved from the installed port by driver
//! identity, exactly as the production transport resolves it, so the arm cannot
//! drift from what the driver runs. An Agent whose dialect has moved into its own
//! package builds its arm through [`Replay::with_dialect`] and hands the dialect
//! over, so this crate still learns no Agent's protocol.
