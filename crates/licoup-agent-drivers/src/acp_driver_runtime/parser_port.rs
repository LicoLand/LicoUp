//! The port this crate's ACP transport engines read one Agent's frame dialect
//! through.
//!
//! This crate owns the shared ACP dialect: the framing that feeds a session,
//! the protocol reducers `acp_driver_runtime::protocol` and
//! `acp_session_transport::protocol` drive, the pooled transport, the session
//! lifecycle and the local service control plane. It owns no Agent's protocol
//! policy. Everything the shared dialect needs *about* one Agent's frames —
//! which byte-line decoder reads them, whether a frame is a notification or a
//! response to a known request, what a session update or a prompt result says,
//! and how a failure is turned into the shared transition vocabulary — arrives
//! through [`AcpParserRegistration`], and the composition above this crate
//! supplies the registrations: `licoup-native` while the Agent crates do not
//! exist, `licoup-agent-<agent>` once they do.
//!
//! The transport is keyed by **driver identity**, because that is the identity
//! the transport already pools and cancels sessions by: one entry answers for
//! every ACP session reached through one driver. Several Agents legitimately
//! share one dialect — Copilot, OpenCode and Kilo Code speak the same ACP
//! profile today — and they select it by declaring the same `driver_id`, or by
//! answering with the same functions. A registration therefore does not name an
//! Agent, and nothing in this module is a vendor branch.
//!
//! Every member is a `fn` pointer rather than a trait, so this crate keeps no
//! state a caller did not hand it. A build that installs no registration
//! answers fail-closed — nothing decodes, nothing completes, nothing
//! validates — rather than inheriting a guess, so a capability that is absent
//! is reported as absent and never as a malformed frame.
