//! The endpoint approval authority the ACP session transport's park-and-inbox
//! registration evaluates a parked interaction against.
//!
//! The authority is the host's own: it decides whether a parked interaction may
//! be raised, registers it with the endpoints that may answer, and fans the
//! request out. This crate declares the two evaluations it asks for and the
//! composition above this crate answers them — `licoup-native` today, whose
//! Secure Mesh approval authority lives inside the host — so the transport
//! names no authority and depends on no security crate.
//!
//! A build that composes nothing answers fail-closed: an evaluation that cannot
//! be made is a refusal, never a silent allow.
