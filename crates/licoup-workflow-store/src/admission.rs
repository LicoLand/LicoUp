//! Host-wide unfinished-work read for the durable Adaptive Flywheel store.
//!
//! The strategy database is the local authority for queued, paused, held and
//! unfinished workflow work. [`StrategyStore::unfinished_local_work`] answers
//! that question in one bounded read so a maintenance owner can refuse to
//! replace installed state while this host still owns workflow work.
//!
//! # What blocks, and what does not
//!
//! * An unfinished run (`strategy_runs.terminal=0`) blocks: its commands and
//!   transitions still have to settle.
//! * A `pending` or `claimed` queue item blocks: `pending` is work this host
//!   queued, `claimed` is work a local claimant holds. A claimant that
//!   disconnected without settling leaves exactly this row.
//! * An active pause request blocks: the graph is negotiating a pause and the
//!   paused work is still owned here.
//! * An active graph barrier blocks: the graph is deliberately held, and
//!   replacing the state it runs against would strand it.
//! * An unsettled invocation blocks. Today every writer records settlement in
//!   the same write that admits the invocation, so this arm covers records a
//!   recovery path has yet to settle rather than a normal transient.
//!
//! A `workflow_stop_requests` row does **not** block by itself. It is a durable
//! control fact that stays true after the stop is honoured; counting it would
//! keep this host permanently busy after its first stop. What blocks is the
//! run, queue item or held graph the stop has not finished settling.
//! `workflow_transition_intents`, `workflow_control_admissions` and
//! `workflow_subscriptions` are delivery and idempotency records, not locally
//! owned tasks, so they never block on their own.
