//! Durable workflow state, command, queue, subscription, and commit contracts.
//!
//! This crate is the independent durable owner of the Adaptive Flywheel
//! strategy database. It sits below the workflow runtime and the kernel host:
//!
//! ```text
//!   licoup-native  ──►  licoup-workflow-runtime  ──►  licoup-workflow-store  ──►  licoup-workflow
//!     (composes)            (executes)                   (persists)                 (pure machine)
//! ```
//!
//! Nothing here names the runtime or the host. Routing, subscription, and
//! admission control are the store's own durable contracts, which is why they
//! live with the store rather than above it: the store previously read them
//! back out of the runtime module, and that read is what made the runtime and
//! the store one cycle instead of one direction.
//!
//! The strategy database remains the local workflow authority. Runtime code
//! owns adapters and execution; this crate owns the short SQLite transactions
//! that make accepted state and delivery intent recoverable across a process
//! restart.
