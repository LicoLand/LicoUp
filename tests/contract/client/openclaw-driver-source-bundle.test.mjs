// The OpenClaw adapter's source split, across the client and its package.
//
// Both halves of OpenClaw live in `crates/licoup-agent-openclaw` now: the
// Gateway ACP state machine, the byte-line codec, the allowlisted update
// projection, the run and failure vocabulary, the session continuity binding,
// the request validation, the endpoint policy, and the reviewed process half —
// the bounded capability probe, the Gateway attach, the supervised bridge, the
// bounded transport and the cleanup.
//
// This contract states the split: the host declares no OpenClaw driver module or
// tree, the composition reads the package without keeping a copy of its
// protocol, the host answers the package's Gateway port from its own Gateway
// engine, the package reaches no client crate, and the moved process half still
// carries the fixed Gateway ACP lane, exact continuity, bounded IO, cleanup and
// privacy the client has always required.
