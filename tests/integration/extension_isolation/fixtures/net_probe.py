"""A real outbound-connection probe for the V7-X2 isolation suite.

It does not speak the extension protocol: it attempts one TCP connection to a
loopback port named by its first argument and records the observable result in
its own (writable) working directory. The test owns the listener, so a refusal
is a policy decision, not a missing service.
