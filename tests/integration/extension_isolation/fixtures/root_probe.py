"""A fork-free filesystem confinement probe for the V7-X2 isolation suite.

It attempts one write outside its roots, one read outside its roots and one write
inside its own root, catches each refusal as an error (so nothing aborts), and
records the three outcomes in its writable working directory. Python creation
probes live in `group_escape.py`; this one is about paths.

Usage: root_probe.py <outside_write> <outside_read>
