LicoUp has one application identity, installed name, and data root. `nightly`
and `stable` are release tracks of that identity, not side-by-side apps or
distribution transports. Direct and app-store remain packaging transport
values.

## Conversion ownership and endpoints

The native migration owner converts the last published product's persisted format
to the planned release's format. The embedded frontier catalogue is the authority
for this single source/target pair; [Compatibility](../COMPATIBILITY.md) projects
it. A product release number is not necessarily the identifier its shipped binary
recorded. Preserve the recorded identifier and published step prefixes. A local
build or schema correction does not establish another supported release.

Store owners define physical schemas and conversions. Startup admission and the
standalone native tool use those owners, rather than separate format writers.
The standalone tool is a separately downloadable client-release asset, not a
permanently bundled package, and must run without Node.js or an installed client.
Its packaging and command delivery are separate from the admission implementation
described here. Retained repository diagnostics are developer tools, not another
supported conversion authority. There is no arbitrary historical-target selection
or downgrade conversion contract.

Explicit maintenance requires stopped writers and a recoverable source. The short
startup `admission.lock` does not prove that runtime writers have stopped. Preserve
the source before an authorized real-data transition and rehearse in a disposable
root; never use a live store to debug the target schema. Protected credentials
remain behind their platform custody and authorization boundary.

Conversion records per-domain progress. A committed store is authoritative over a
stale marker or journal, and recovery reconciles the completed step rather than
repeating it. There is no atomic transaction spanning all databases, files and
operating-system credential stores. Data-dependent conversion failures remain
forward-only `migration_step_failed` apply/retry work; a read-only structural
preflight does not certify every stored business value.

## Client update selection

The native artifact embeds its product version, release track, and immutable
state-migration frontier. A local development build defaults to Nightly;
distributable builds provide the track explicitly. Update selection compares
SemVer precedence only:

- Nightly automatically accepts a strictly newer Nightly.
- Nightly may explicitly select a strictly newer Stable.
- Stable automatically accepts a strictly newer Stable.
- Stable never selects Nightly; equal and older versions are never eligible.

The signed manifest-v2 binds the target track and each release's exact
migration frontier. Human migration notes are descriptive only. The caller
cannot override the running version, running track, frontier, or migration
steps.

A successful check of the canonical public Stable release can establish that
its version is equal to or older than the running version even when that
release has no update manifest. This is a published-version observation only:
it carries no verified key, artifact or replacement receipt. A missing manifest
for a newer, unknown or Nightly version is reported as unavailable metadata.
If a manifest is present, its signed verification remains mandatory regardless
of the release tag. Network and integrity failures remain failures; a stale
cache cannot conceal a failed verification. Starting a new check clears any
previous candidate receipt before adopting its result.

Before replacement, native update verification writes a claim bound to the
selected version, target track, exact frontier, and artifact receipt. The new
binary must match that claim before migration admission; a mismatch blocks
before any state mutation. The current updater recovers a claimed replacement
by installing the same or a newer forward-capable candidate. It does not authorize
data downgrade.

## Startup admission

After resolving the raw data directory, the desktop lifecycle invokes native
state admission before loading the workspace, preferences, conversations,
Adaptive Flywheel, Mobile Relay, or another product-state consumer. Admission
locks the root, probes every domain, proves a contiguous plan, and persists the
product-version high-water before the first schema mutation. Each durable step
commits through an atomic file replacement or its owning database transaction;
the bounded ledger is updated only after its authoritative postcondition.
Conversation and Adaptive Flywheel SQLite metadata, workspace and presentation
documents, Mobile Relay configuration, and the remaining declared preference
documents are probed at their owning stores. Markers record reconciliation for
an absent store; they never substitute for probing an existing store.

Before high-water, frontier or domain-marker advancement, SQLite admission checks
the complete retained owner layout: columns, nullability, defaults, primary and
unique keys, CHECK expressions, partial-index predicates, foreign-key actions,
collations and other write constraints. Definitions come from the actual owner
DDL. Older supported Conversation layouts are upgraded schema-only in memory and
compared to that full contract, not to a startup column subset. Workflow tables
created on demand may be absent; malformed existing tables are refused. The
released nullable-terminal producer variant remains valid. Unrecognized structural
definitions are refused, not silently repaired or treated as equivalent SQL.

The retained JavaScript evaluator uses the same owner DDL and structural upgrade
steps. SQLite inspection errors remain bounded per-domain refusals; they never
certify an unreadable store or erase sibling observations. Independent frozen
fixtures exercise native admission, real owner reads and writes, and the actual
diagnostic evaluator. Changed owner and fixture inputs select those existing
regression suites through the module catalogue.

The `gateway-credential-custody` domain is a protected continuation of this
frontier. macOS roots without a completed custody receipt report it in
`pendingAuthorizationDomainIds` and remain ready; admission never opens the
Keychain. An empty data directory cannot prove that no legacy Keychain items
exist. The explicit `llm-gateway credentials migrate`
operation completes the protected work described in
[credential custody](../protocols/llm-gateway.md#credential-custody), then writes
its completion marker and reconciles the same migration ledger. Failed or
cancelled work remains pending. The custody operation holds a separate lock,
so a native approval dialog does not block unrelated startup admission.

Current domains are skipped and a rerun is a no-op. State ahead of the binary,
unknown shapes, gaps, and incomplete or failed steps keep startup closed with a
stable privacy-safe error code. A committed step is reconciled and not replayed
after a crash. Durable user and security state is never silently reset.

The native build generates the update-handoff and Adaptive Flywheel artifact
state types and transitions from one declarative state-machine resource. The
handoff owner validates and persists the generated pending-to-claimed transition;
the strategy-store owner applies generated transitions through the existing
SQLite migration APIs. These modules own admission effects, while the generated
tables remain the transition authority.

The current admission implementation can recover by reinstalling the same
verified capable build or a newer signed build and retrying. It denies an older
binary after high-water advances. It does not lower metadata to let an older
binary open a newer store.

### Workflow store conversion

The current source advances the Adaptive Flywheel store from SQLite schema 2 to
3 and its admission frontier from 1 to 2. The existing migration owner materializes
historical implicit entry slots and effect routes once. Conversion and the schema
marker commit in one SQLite transaction. Only the actual released schema-2 layout
and current schema-3 layout are admitted; completed frontier-1 ledgers and markers
advance through the registered next step.

The conversion preserves revision and semantics identities, run snapshots,
command attempts, leases and grants. Immutable package bytes keep their original
digests; package verification validates that identity before applying historical
format interpretation. Ordinary compilation accepts canonical definitions and
does not rewrite them. This forward conversion does not establish another
historical compatibility format.

## Publication

Nightly publication is prepared from `nightly` under the fixed `nightly`
prerelease; Stable publication remains an immutable `v{version}` release from
`release`. Both profiles preserve `land.lico.licoup`, `LicoUp.app`, and the
shared root. A Stable promotion must be non-prerelease and strictly newer than
the last Stable and installed Nightly; a same-version Stable is not offered.
Publication validation compares SemVer precedence (build metadata cannot break
a tie), rejects a regressed migration frontier, and verifies the shared app
identity before signing.
